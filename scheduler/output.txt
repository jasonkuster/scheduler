adding:  331 ANTH The Most Ancient Near East The Near East, archaeologically, is the most intensely researched area in the world.  The research, spanning 150 years, reveals a continuous record of human adaptation spanning two million years, five human species, multiple major environmental changes, and shifts in human adaptive strategies from nomadic hunting and gathering to sedentary village agriculture and the emergence of urban centers "civilization."  The archaeological record of this extraordinary period beginning two million years ago until about 4000 BC is reviewed.  Emphasis is placed on the human response to social and ecological changes.  The course examines how the emergence of sedentary settlements, surplus food production, population growth, interregional trade, and social-economically stratified societies fundamentally changed the human condition.

adding:  503 ANTH Seminar in Social Cultural Anthropology Ethnographic writing, particularly in the form of a monograph, is not only the final stage of the research process for sociocultural anthropologists, it is also the currency of the discipline.  Through this format, anthropologists present findings from their fieldwork and make particular claims, or arguments that attempt to further our understanding of human social life, behavior, and cultural patterns.  This seminar will explore this process through the close reading of contemporary ethnographic monographs.  The goal of the course is to develop both critical reading skills and an understanding of how to structure a persuasive argument.  This coure is intended to build on skills developed in the research methods, research design, and theory courses, although they are not prerequisites. Fall 2012

adding:  390 ARTH Introduction to the Art Object and its Explication A basic introduction to the museum and gallery worlds as institutions with a focus on the work of art, and on the institution's responsibility to the art object.  Skills are to be developed in stylistic and conceptual analyses, problem solving, and critical thought.  Emphasis will be placed on written and verbal expression to be developed to articulate visual works of art.  The institutional function of the museum or gallery is studied as driven by the acquisition, care, and explication of the object as an entity, or in connection with others of like kind.  That there is a building, a director, a Board of Trustees, curators, conservators, a Registrar, security officers, a maintenance crew, is all in response to the art object as one in a gathering of such, or collection.  The course is intended as a pre-professional, experiential introduction to the functioning of  the art museum with site visits and presentations by museum professionals. Fall 2012

adding:  357 BAFI Financial Modeling, Analysis and Decision Making Firms try to create value. In their day-to-day operations, they are faced with numerous challenges: Should we accept trade credit or borrow? Will an acquisition create or destroy value? Should we introduce a new product line even if it cannibalizes an existing one? In each of these situations they try to quantify the impact on the value of their firm. The goal of this course is to develop your skills in financial modeling and valuation, so you can tackle issues like the ones described above. The course is designed to be "hands-on": You will learn to apply the theory and develop spreadsheet modeling skills through homework, case studies and a group project. By the end of the course you will have a good understanding of both the theory and practice of valuation, and possess a set of cutting-edge financial modeling skills. This course is designed for students who aspire to work in a regular company, a bank or a consulting firm in (i) corporate finance (including mergers and acquisitions); (ii) strategy; or (iii) equity and analysis.

adding:  450 BAFI Mergers and Acquisitions This course examines the economic rationale and motivation for the different merger and acquisition and recapitalization activities undertaken by firms and individuals in the U.S. market. Emphasis is on the comparable publicly traded proxy company, comparable "change of control" transaction, and discounted cash flow methods of valuing a firm. The class will also review the different types of debt and equity capital employed to fund mergers and acquisitions and recapitalizations, how senior lenders and equity investors structure their loans and/or investments, and how investors realize the gains through different exit strategies. The legal and tax ramifications of various forms of M&A activity are also discussed. The course gives the student an excellent understanding of the role that senior commercial banks, insurance companies, pension funds, LBO funds, investment banking firms, and venture/growth capital investors play in mergers and acquisitions and will strengthen the students' ability to value a business enterprise.

adding:  409 BETH Global Justice and Bioethics This course aims to introduce students to the problem of global distributive justice, with an emphasis on both theoretical accounts of justice, and the practical implications of those accounts for important topics in global bioethics. The first half of this course will be devoted to important contemporary works which bring out core philosophical ideas about justice and how we address concerns of justice globally. The second half of this course will focus on current global bioethics topics, such as inequality and poverty, global intellectual property rights, the allocation of healthcare resources, the setting of research priorities, exploitation & the distribution of the benefits of research, and medical tourism.

In addition to familiarizing students with the contemporary literature regarding global justice and related topics in bioethics, this course also seeks to help students strengthen their skills in reading, analyzing, interpreting, and engaging with philosophy and bioethics texts. This course is a seminar and will therefore emphasize in-class discussion rather than lecture. Students are expected to prepare by reading all assigned readings before class. Fall 2012

adding:  430 BETH Bioethics in Literature This course complements the Foundation course in the MA bioethics program by introducing students to narrative literature (fiction, nonfiction and poetry) that addresses ethical issues in medicine.  The material is frequently the work of physicians and patients who narrate their respective experiences.  As such, narrative provides direct insights into the practice of modern medicine tested against both accepted and controversial moral norms and serves as a vehicle for discussion and analysis of ethical issues.  These issues involve topics such as death and dying, reproduction, pediatrics, women as patients and clinicians, public health and medicine as a profession and its practice as a privilege.  Students will sample the work, among others, of William Carlos Williams, Lewis Thomas, Toni Morrison, Margaret Atwood, John Donne, Dylan Thomas and Abraham Verghese. Fall 2012

adding:  511 BETH Grant Writing This course will teach students the fundaments of writing a grant proposal. We will concentrate on NIH-style applications, although the principals of grant writing can be applied to any venue. In the process of working through devising a research question and study design, students will be encouraged to use this as an opportunity to think about their dissertation topic. In addition to applying theoretical and research design knowledge gained through their other core course work, the course will also teach students about how to complete application forms and to create a budget. We will also familiarize students with the peer review process. Each student will produce a draft grant application. The students will form a mock peer review section and will critique the grants.

adding:  240 BIOL Personalized Medicine The emphasis of clinical practice is slowly shifting from one-disease and one-treatment-fits-all to more personalized care based on molecular markers of disease risk, disease subtype, drug effectiveness, and adverse drug reactions.  This course, designed for non-biology majors, will introduce how the developments in gene sequencing, genetic markers, and stem cells can be applied for predictive testing and personalized therapies.  Core concepts to be covered include the principles of genetics including the inheritance of traits determined by single genes and by multiple genes, the assignment of risk to particular genetic constitutions, and the nature and use of stem cells.  The emergence of private companies as resources for the performance of the tests, and how the general public will be able to interpret their own data (with or without the access to genetic counselors), will also be covered.  The course will include hands-on laboratory experiences of DNA manipulation and detection using the polymerase chain reaction and gel electrophoresis.  The ethical, legal, and social issues associated with personal genetic testing will also be covered.  This course does not count towards any Biology degree, nor towards the Biology minor. Fall 2012

adding:  384 BIOL Reading and Writing Like an Ecologist Students usually learn from textbooks, but scientists communicate with each other through journal articles.  The purpose of this class is to help you learn to read and write like an ecologist.  We will spend our time reading and discussing journal articles about three or four issues in ecology, including papers from both empirical and theoretical perspectives.  In addition to the science, we'll talk about strategies for how to keep reading when you encounter something you don't understand and what makes a paper well or poorly written. At the end of each section, you will synthesize your ideas into a review article.  Your initial paper will be submitted to me as hypothetical journal editor.  I will send your paper out for review to two fellow classmates, and I'll send their comments back to you along with brief comments of my own.  As all scientists know, it is virtually unheard of for a journal to accept a paper for publication without revisions.  After this peer review, you will revise your papers and resubmit them to me.  Your grade will be based on your participation in class discussions, your papers (both drafts) and your work as a reviewer for other students. Fall 2012

adding:  381 CLSC Classics Senior Capstone The capstone is the final requirement of the SAGES program and is normally taken in the fall semester of senior year.  It involves an independent study paper resulting from exploration of a topic chosen in consultation with the student's capstone advisor, who will regularly review progress on the project.  In the capstone students employ, integrate, and demonstrate analytical, rhetorical, and practical skills developed and honed through the SAGES curriculum as well as their major or minor studies.  The Capstone Project has both a written and an oral component: oral presentation and argumentation will be stressed.  The product of the capstone may take different forms: there will always be a written component, but other forms of expression are also encouraged, such as a webpage or poster for a poster session.  As for the kind of project that might be done: students interested in literature might work on an annotated translation of a classical text; archaeology students might produce a virtual exhibit centered on a specific site or problem.

adding:  381 CLSC Classics Senior Capstone The capstone is the final requirement of the SAGES program and is normally taken in the fall semester of senior year.  It involves an independent study paper resulting from exploration of a topic chosen in consultation with the student's capstone advisor, who will regularly review progress on the project.  In the capstone students employ, integrate, and demonstrate analytical, rhetorical, and practical skills developed and honed through the SAGES curriculum as well as their major or minor studies.  The Capstone Project has both a written and an oral component: oral presentation and argumentation will be stressed.  The product of the capstone may take different forms: there will always be a written component, but other forms of expression are also encouraged, such as a webpage or poster for a poster session.  As for the kind of project that might be done: students interested in literature might work on an annotated translation of a classical text; archaeology students might produce a virtual exhibit centered on a specific site or problem.

adding:  101 COGS Introduction to Cognitive Science This course introduces students to the field of cognitive science.  Cognitive scientists are interested in the nature of the human mind--basically, we ask how humans think.  This is a huge question, and has been addressed in one way or another by pretty much every academic field.  Cognitive science tries to unite work from many different fields, including computer science, neuroscience, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, music, art, and literary theory.  In this course, you'll get a basic introduction to some of the topics that are central to human cognition, such as intelligence, categorization, language, and creativity.  We'll ask what can be gained by taking an integrated, cognitive scientific approach to these topics. Fall 2012

adding:  329 COGS Performance and the Embodied Mind In the past twenty years cognitive scientists working in neuroscience, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and related fields have made great progress in understanding perception, empathy, the human mind's sense of space and movement, emotions, meaning-making, and many other cognitive areas that are crucial to producing, enacting, and responding to performances on stage.  This course will look at ways of incorporating many of the insights of cognitive science into the existing work of theatre and performance scholarship.  The course will thus link a more traditional approach to the body in theatre and dance studies, where it has commonly been considered one of the main means of communication, to a most up-to-date research on embodied cognition.  Observation of live and pre-recorded dance and theatre performances will regularly be used to supplement the theoretical discussion. Recommended preparation: COGS 101, COGS 202. Fall 2012

adding:  390 COGS Introduction to General Semiotics Semiotics, the study of meaning and signs conveying meaning, is a central part of cognitive semiotics, or 'high level' cognitive semantics.  This discipline is typically taught in departments of linguistics, cognitive science, philosophy, or cultural studies.  The domain of semiotics is in fact widely intersecting with other disciplines (general linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, anthropology, music, literature, architecture, and the arts).  Sign theory, text theory, studies of narrative structure, enunciation, natural logic, rhetoric and poetics, speech act forms, are important components in this field. Fall 2012

adding:  370 EBME Principles of Biomedical Engineering Design Students learn and implement the design process to produce working prototypes of medical devices with potential commercial value to meet significant clinical needs.  Critical examination of contemporary medical problems is used to develop a specific problem statement.  The class is divided into teams of 3 to 4 students.  Each team integrates their knowledge and skills to design a device to meet their clinical need.  Project planning and management, including resource allocation, milestones, and documentation, are required to ensure successful completion of projects within the allotted time and budget.  Formal design reviews by a panel of advisors and outside medical device experts are required every four weeks.  Every student is required to give oral presentations at each formal review and is responsible for formal documentation of the design process, resulting in an executive summary and complete design history file of the project.  The course culminates with a public presentation of the team's device to a panel of experts.  This course is expected to provide the student with a real-world, capstone design experience.

adding:  307 ECON Intermediate Macro Theory Macroeconomics studies aggregate indicators of the performance of an economy, most commonly measured in terms of GDP, unemployment rate and inflation rate. An important goal of macroeconomic researchers is to develop a model of an economy that is simple, yet powerful enough to explain the historical trends of these aggregate economic indicators. Needless to say, coming up with a good model has remained a very difficult task. So far, there is no single model that is good enough to coherently explain even the most prominent historical trends of aggregate economic indicators. But several models have been built, each offering insight into a certain aspect of the economy. Throughout the course model building is motivated by real world cases from the American economy.

The main focus of the class will be theoretical, in order to give you a solid foundation for future study in virtually any other field of economics. This includes the theory of how consumers decide what to consume and how firms decide when to stay in business, and how much to produce at what price.

adding:  326 ECON Econometrics Econometrics is the application of statistics to empirical economic analysis. One way of testing the validity of economic theories is to gather data and apply statistical tests to see if the data support the theory. These data are usually gathered by observing actual economies, firms and consumers, rather than by performing experiments in a laboratory. Because economic analysts lack the precision and control of the laboratory, they must compensate by adjusting their statistical procedures. In this class, we will concentrate on regression analysis, which is the basic tool of the economic researcher. We will study the assumptions commonly made in the application of this technique, the consequences of violating these assumptions, and the corrections that can be made. Students will have a chance to formulate and test their own hypotheses using econometric software available for personal computers.  Recommended preparation: One semester of statistics or consent of instructor. Fall 2012

adding:  330 ECON Economic Behavior and Psychology This course will cover the relatively new field of Behavioral Economics, also sometimes called "Psychology and Economics."  Behavioral economics involves incorporating insights into economics from other disciplines that enrich the understanding of how people make economic decisions.  Most of the crossovers come from the field of psychology, but there is also a growing interest in ideas from sociology and neuroscience.  We will cover fundamental concepts related to decision-making, such as how people respond to risk, how people make decisions over time, and the ways in which people really aren't as selfish as economists sometimes make it seem.  We will also discuss empirical work that shows how these concepts affect how economists think about real-world issues.  Examples include examining how to set the default options for 401k programs, understanding why people pay for costly gym memberships they do not use, and looking at whether sellers on Ebay use the best possible ending times for their auctions.

It enables students to think about the world "like an economist."  Possible topics of current interest include the transformation of Eastern Europe, ethnic and racial strife, environmental policy and sustainable development, and professional sports. Fall 2012
adding:  368 ECON Environmental Economics This course will use economic theory as an aid to understanding environmental problems and their solutions. We will start with a study of the firm. Once we have developed an understanding of firms' incentives to pollute and overexploit natural resources, we will learn how various economic policies can change these incentives and thus prevent environmental degradation. Thereafter, we will evaluate the efficiency of these economic policies. Finally, we will apply our theoretical analysis to specific environmental problems. Fall 2012
adding:  369 ECON Economics of Technological Innovation and Entrepreneurship This course is designed to help students identify, evaluate, and obtain control over technological opportunities so they may successfully understand the challenges of starting new companies. The course focuses on four themes: 1) the source, discovery and evaluation of technological opportunities; 2) the process of organizing a new firm to produce new technology that satisfies the needs of customers; 3) the acquisition of financial and human resources necessary to exploit technological opportunities; and 4) the development of mechanism to appreciate the returns from exploitation of technological opportunities.

adding:  375 ECON Economics of Developing Countries This course focuses on international aspects of economic development. The term "developing country" is often defined as a country that exhibits low per capita income, high poverty level, low level of industrialization, or low life expectancy. In terms of size, the developing countries make up at least three-fourth of the world population. Why do we study those countries' economies separately from the industrialized economies? In fact, low economic growth, high unemployment, or high poverty rates also exist in many developed countries. The differences lie not in the types of problems but in the causes of these problems. In addition, differences in the kind of institutions that prevail in developing countries also lead to different policy prescriptions. Among developing countries, differences in historical experience, cultural practices, political institutions and economic conditions are also enormous. Illustrations and explanations of those differences are provided from a wide range of developing countries. Fall 2012

adding:  378 ECON Health Care Economics The health care industry is the fastest growing sector of the U.S. economy, with expenditures on health care now accounting for over 14% of total GDP. Because of its complexity and sheer size, the health care industry affects virtually every facet of the economy including labor productivity, income distribution and international competitiveness. The goal of ECON 378 is to apply the tools of economic analysis to develop students' understanding of health care markets and related public policy issues. The course begins with an overview of the health care system in the U.S. with attention to disturbing statistics that have inspired calls for reform. The remainder of the course is approximately divided between analysis of the consumer side of the health care market and analysis of the provider side. Throughout the course, proposals for reforming the health care system will be described and discussed. Fall 2012

adding:  613 EDMP Leading Change Change is an enigma and yet sustained, desirable change (SDC) drives adaptation, growth and life itself.  In this course, we will continuously attempt to answer two questions: What is the process of sustained, desirable change?  and What is the role of a leader?  Concepts from complexity theory will be used, including understanding the multilevel nature of SDC at the individual, dyad,  team, organization, community, country, and global levels.  Intentional Change Theory (ICT) will be used as the organizing concept for the changes studied.  Leadership and its development will be examined by studying a number of topics and applying them to three major case studies: (1) yourself; (2) practice coaching with compassion; and (3) a major change project.  This course will explore questions, such as: Who are effective leaders?  How do they think and act?  What makes us want to follow them?  How are leaders developed?  What is the role of emotional and social intelligence?  How does a leader's mind, body, heart, and spirit affect their performance? Fall 2012

adding:  641 EDMP Qualitative Inquiry II This course guides the student in conducting the qualitative research project that was proposed in EDMP 638.  Fieldwork and initial analysis is conducted during the summer when data based on semi-structure interviews is collected and analysis begins using inductive coding techniques.  A summer residency is held in mid-June to assess progress as final data collection and analysis continues.  The aim of the fall semester is to prepare a formal research report on that project, which will be submitted to an academic research conference.  The final report includes a revision of one's conceptual model, integrating new understandings and literature arising from the data collection and analysis. Fall 2012

adding:  665 EDMP Introduction to Research Inquiry This course begins participants' three-year research experience.  Energized by one's personal passion and commitment to the topic, we seek for the work to be accomplished at a level that makes it worthy of widespread dissemination and influence as engaged scholars.  The goal in this course is to prepare students to develop their minds as scholars by understanding the world of research; develop a research identity by identifying one's research domain; learn to read academic literature and write in a scholarly style; work with academic literature to identify and digest concepts and theories that inform research on that problem; begin to develop a conceptual model that abstracts how the world may be functioning in that problem domain and points to a research question that can guide the next stage of the research.  The final deliverable for this course is to present the research topic with substantiation for its significance, relevance and timeliness in the management field.  This would include the research question(s); the literature review; and proposed qualitative methodology and analytical approach(es). Fall 2012

adding:  386 EDUC Introduction to Instructional Technology This course is designed to address the basic technology skills, which are required of all teachers. The course uses both concept and project based learning activities. Each of the projects is centered on a set of activities designed to allow students to demonstrate a particular subset of competencies. The course will not always provide step by step directions for completing projects; instead it will promote the use of existing information and help resources to allow students to develop the ability to learn new technology independently. Each of the projects will also contain the opportunity for the student to reflect on how technology impacts their teaching.
Course projects are designed to assess both a basic comfort level with learning and using technology tools and the student's ability to apply technology to improve teaching and learning. The nature of the course is a mix of technology and should engage teachers in thinking about ways to improve their teaching.

adding:  440 EECS Machine Learning Machine learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence that is concerned with the design and analysis of algorithms that "learn" and improve with experience,  While the broad aim behind research in this area is to build systems that can simulate or even improve on certain aspects of human intelligence, algorithms developed in this area have become very useful in analyzing and predicting the behavior of complex systems.  Machine learning algorithms have been used to guide diagnostic systems in medicine, recommend interesting products to customers in e-commerce, play games at human championship levels, and solve many other very complex problems.  This course is focused on algorithms for machine learning: their design, analysis and implementation.  We will study different learning settings, including supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised learning.  We will study different ways of representing the learning problem, using propositional, multiple-instance and relational representations.  We will study the different algorithms that have been developed for these settings, such as decision trees, neural networks, support vector machines, k-means, harmonic functions and Bayesian methods.  We will learn about the theoretical tradeoffs in the design of these algorithms, and how to evaluate their behavior in practice.  At the end of the course, you should be able to:
   --Recognize situations where machine learning algorithms are applicable;
   --Understand, represent and formulate the learning problem;
   --Apply the appropriate algorithm(s), or if necessary, design your own, with an understanding of the tradeoffs involved;
   --Correctly evaluate the behavior of the algorithm when solving the problem. Fall 2012

adding:  495 EECS Nanometer VLSI Design Semiconductor industry has evolved rapidly over the past four decades to meet the increasing demand on computing power by continuous miniaturization of devices. Now we are in the nanometer technology regime with the device dimensions scaled below 100nm. VLSI design using nanometer technologies involves some major challenges. This course will explain all the major challenges associated with nanoscale VLSI design such as dynamic and leakage power, parameter variations, reliability and robustness. The course will present modeling and analysis techniques for timing, power and noise in nanometer era. Finally, the course will cover the circuit/architecture level design solutions for low power, high-performance, testable and robust VLSI system. The techniques will be applicable to design of microprocessor, digital signal processor (DSP) as well as application specific integrated circuits (ASIC). The course includes a project which requires the student to work on a nanometer design issue. Recommended preparation: EECS 426 or EECS 485. Fall 2012

adding:  520 EECS Robust Control One of the most important problems in modern control theory is that of controlling the output of a system so as to achieve asymptotic tracking of prescribed signals and/or asymptotic rejection of undesired disturbances.  The problem can be solved by the so-called regulator theory and H-infinity control theory.  This course presents a self-contained introduction to these two important design methods.  The intention of this course is to present ideas and methods on such a level that the beginning graduate student will be able to follow current research.  Both linear and nonlinear results will be covered.  Recommended preparation: EECS 408. Fall 2012

adding:  360 EMAE Design and Manufacturing II This is the third course of a 4-course sequence focusing on "Engineering Design and Manufacturing," and is the senior capstone design course focused on a semester-long design/build/evaluate project.  The course draws on a student's past and present academic and industrial experiences and exposes them to the design and manufacture of a product or device that solves an open-ended "real world" problem with multidimensional constraints.  The course is structured and time-tabled within the Case School of Engineering (CSE) to give the EMAE 360 students the opportunity to team with students from other CSE departments (e.g., BME and EECS) to form multidisciplinary design teams to work on the solution to a common problem.  The outcomes of the course continue to focus on the student's ability to function on multidisciplinary teams while applying their knowledge of mathematics, science and engineering to design a system, component, or process that meets desired needs within realistic, multidimensional constraints, such as: economic, environmental, social, political, ethical, health and safety, manufacturability, and sustainability.  Professional communication skills are emphasized and expected during all stages of the design process and will include formal and informal oral presentations, periodic peer-focused design reviews, and a development through its various evolutionary stages to completion.

Related mathematics and theories including group theory (Lie groups), rigid-body motions (SO(3) and SE(3)), kinematics, dynamics, and control will be studied.  In addition, the class will also discuss structural, computational and task complexity in robotic systems based on combinatorial analysis, information theory, and graph theory.

Lecture and discussion topics:
Kinematics;
Introduction to Group Theory and Lie Groups; Rigid-body Motions (SO(3), SE(3));
Multi-body Dynamical Systems: Order-N computational methods;
Complexity Analysis for Robotic Systems; Structural complexity, information-theoretic complexity, and task complexity;
Special Discussion Topics; Special discussion topics may vary each year.
Students enrolled in this class will be required to conduct a final project.  Two or three students will work as a team.  The topics for student teams may include: computer simulation of multi-body dynamical systems, art robot design, and complexity analysis for coupled complex systems.  The detailed information will be provided in the first week of the class.  The final presentations and demonstrations will be held during the last week of class and will be open to the public audience.  Students are also required to submit a final report following a IEEE conference paper template. Fall 2012

adding:  436 EMBA Accounting for Business Executives This course is an introduction to financial and managerial accounting, rather than a course in introductory accounting.  This course is designed for the business professional and is intended to prepare the student to use the information prepared by accountants.  It will not dwell in detail on the technical aspects of accounting or bookkeeping.  In addition, this course is designed to help the student become an effective user of cost information, from the perspective of parties internal to the firm.  This aspect of accounting is a compilation of techniques rather than a set of rules.  Since the information is for private use, the goal is to create the most meaningful and useful data for use by managers.  Assignments will be designed to develop the student's ability to analyze and interpret accounting data and to more effectively utilize accounting data in day to day business decisions.  Finally, this course is intended to strengthen abilities to identify problems and opportunities, to search out and analyze desired information leading to a well-reasoned conclusion, and to perform sensitivity analysis around that conclusion, using financial information.

adding:  443 EMBA Supply Chain Management Operations managers, ranging from supervisors to vice presidents, are concerned with the production of goods and services.  More specifically, they are responsible for designing, running, controlling and improving the systems that accomplish production.  This course is a broad-spectrum course with emphasis on techniques and information that are helpful to the practice of management in general and at any level.

We will discuss commonly occurring application problems such as process analysis, inventory control, quality management, just-in-time concepts, etc.  The field of operations management was originally concerned with manufacturing systems.  But many of the same ideas apply, and the same trade-offs are present, in service organizations like health care, insurance, hotel-management, airlines and government related operations.  Several manufacturing and non-manufacturing environments will be discussed explicitly, and the emphasis will be on the fundamentals of the operations function in an organization.  Also we will explore the interface of operations management with other functional areas such as marketing, finance, accounting, etc. Fall 2012

adding:  446 EMBA Managing Risk and Real Options The course seeks to help corporate managers understand how financial design can be used to advance the goals and strategies of the firm.  In the Finance course, you concentrated almost exclusively on the firm's capital expenditure decision.  You studied in great detail the discounted cash flow model, NPV, how you get your cash flows, and how you discount according to risk.  Now we move to the other side of the balance sheet to look at how the firm can finance these expenditures.  The first part of this class provides the basic building blocks of financial engineering which begins with call and put options.  The course focuses on using derivatives (calls and puts) to change a firm's risk profile with respect to equity, interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, and commodity risks.  We look at capital structure decisions and securitization issues and discuss what it means to create optimal structures.  Almost immediately we will tie this to our financial crisis and obtain an appreciation for financial designs that could be setup so as to enhance firm value, mitigate systemic risks, or accomplish specific sustainable goals in a global economy.  The second part of the class is geared towards real options and its relationship to strategic planning. In competitive markets, no one expects to formulate a detailed long-term plan and follow it mindlessly.  As soon as we start down the path, we begin learning about business conditions, competitors' actions, and so forth and we need to respond flexibly to what we learn.  Unfortunately, the financial tool most widely relied on to estimate the value of strategy, DCF, assumes that we follow a predetermined plan, regardless of how events unfold.  A better approach to valuation would incorporate both the uncertainty inherent in business and the active decision making required for strategy to succeed. Fall 2012

adding:  450 EMBA Managerial Marketing This course is designed with three overarching objectives. The first is an emphasis on decision making in a broad range of market contexts. The second objective builds on the notion that decision making is dynamic; that is, market situations demand not just one good decision but a series of them as a situation unfolds (providing new and varied information for each subsequent decision). Integrating concepts from a number of the courses that you are taking concurrently into decision-making about markets is a final objective. Fall 2012

adding:  451 EMBA Business Model Design In most companies the process of designing business models is an ad hoc process and in my opinion an inefficient process.  In this course you will learn a systematic but iterative process to do this.  We will expose you to some broad categories of business models and internalize the basic logic of how to make money in each of these categories.  The first step is to recognize which of these categories is most applicable to your business.  The second step is to customize these broad patterns to the specifics of the business at hand.  This seems easy because everything is in English and there are no hard formulas to figure out.  However, unless you discipline yourself to systematically go through a structured process (there are other equally valid processes than the ones you'll be exposed to) it is very easy to fall into the ad hoc trap.

You will internalize this process by applying it over a wide range of business situations that will give you confidence in its applicability to any business opportunity.  After the completion of this course you should be quickly able to draw the outline of a business model for any business opportunity that you're considering. Fall 2012

Regulatory areas include employment law and environmental law.  Property coverage includes modern struggles over intellectual ownership claims (patents, copyrights, etc.). Fall 2012

adding:  436 EPBI Essence of Multilevel Statistical Modeling, Including Repeated Measures Analysis A brief introduction to statistical models to handle studies having observational units (cases) at multiple levels (hierarchies).  In particular, cases are often nested within groups, such as distinct communities, healthcare centers, or schools.  Because the cases are not independent, ordinary statistical models (EPBI 432) are not appropriate.  In addition, some research questions suggest case-level analyses; others suggest group-level analyses.  Longitudinal and other repeated measures analyses can be formed by taking the measurements to be nested within independent cases.  Methods include the basic "summary measure" approach and mixed linear model methods, such as random coefficient regression models.  Examples and wise use of software (R and SAS) are stressed in order to develop a strong conceptual understanding of the models.  This course joins EPBI 437 and 438 as the three-step "essence" series in advanced statistical methods required for the PhD in Population Health Science. Fall 2012

adding:  109 FSNA Science and Race This four-credit seminar examines the development and impact of the concept of race. We will first focus on the causes of biological variability in species, leading to an evaluation of whether race is a useful device for understanding biological variability in humans. Second, we will examine how the understanding of race has changed over time within the biological sciences. Third, we will examine how scientific conceptualizations about race have influenced, and been influenced by, cultural beliefs. Through readings and open-ended discussion, we will critically examine the scientific process as it has been (and still is) being applied to the study of human races so that each student will ultimately be equipped to develop a scientifically sound conceptualization of race. Topics which will be covered include Social Darwinism, the eugenics movement, legislation to restrict immigration into the U.S., race-based medicine, and race and intelligence. Students are expected to enhance their skills at critical reading, thoughtful analysis, constructing logical arguments, and improving written and oral communication. Fall 2012

adding:  116 FSNA Cities (Under Construction) Based on the premise that cities are never "finished," and constantly being remade, we will look at the technological and cultural history of cities from the ancient world to the present day. Students will explore the history of building materials--wood, brick, steel, concrete, and glass--used in the construction of cities. We will also trace the development of city infrastructure such as water and sewage systems; streets, bridges, and subways; electricity, telephone and the internet. Specific technological innovations, such as the elevator and the automobile, will receive special consideration. We will move both geographically and temporally to visit the world's great cities, Athens, Mexico City, Tokyo, and New York City. As we do, we will study the examples of significant building projects, such as the Brooklyn Bridge, the Chicago World's Fair, Washington, DC's Metro, and Cleveland's first skyscraper, the Rockefeller Building. The course will cover the history of the professions--engineering, architecture, and urban planning--that have contributed to the construction of cities, and will review the works of these practitioners, as well as that of artists, reformers, and utopians that have imagined new directions for the city. We will also explore first person narratives of the city, the impact of the city on personal and collective memory, and the possibilities and pitfalls of the "virtual" city. Through lecture, discussion, textual analysis, computer simulations, and writing assignments, Cities (Under Construction) will help students gain a deeper understanding of their role in remaking and sustaining the built environment.

The course will require practice in written and oral communications in small groups.  A primary focus of the seminar will be to examine the impact of engineering materials on societal development through human history using a few specific materials of interest as examples: concrete, steel, and semi-conductors.  At the conclusion of the course, students will be encouraged to explore the impact of other materials on the development of specific technologies as a group project. Fall 2012

adding:  123 FSNA The Automobile: Its Origins, Development, and Impact on American Society The automobile is without doubt one of the defining influences on American life and society.  In 1900, most people lived in rural communities, and the main forms of personal transportation were walking and the horse and buggy.  Half a century later, most Americans lived in cities or suburbs, there were millions of cars in garages, and roads and highways criss-crossed the nation.  The car has transformed where we live and work, how we play, and the very nature of our cities.
This course will examine the American automobile from several perspectives: its origins, evolution and effect on industry; its impact on American life and leisure; and the automobile as an art form and American icon.  We will also discuss how we preserve examples of our automotive heritage.  These topics will be explored in the context of the usual writing and discussion components of a first SAGES course.

adding:  126 FSNA Urban Ecology This course will explore the natural world in an urban context.  Urban spaces are defined by the interaction between human creation (the built environment) and the natural world.  We will explore how those definitions can be complicated by human innovation meant to re-create nature, such as engineered wetlands.  We'll read some classical ecology to understand how ecological issues differ in cities.  Some topics we'll cover include: wildlife management; human/organism conflict and interdependence; urban heat islands; watershed, stormwater, and sewer management; and how trees grow in urban conditions.  We'll also explore ethical issues such as environmental justice and sustainable development.  Our field trips are meant to illuminate how urban planners, park managers, and others deal with such issues to create positive and healthy environments for their communities.  Students will apply arguments and concepts learned in the course readings to the sites we visit.. Fall 2012

adding:  127 FSNA Science and Culture of Anatomy This seminar will examine the history of human anatomy as a field of study, a system of knowledge, and a way of looking at the body.  Anatomy is not only the medical language used to describe the body; it is also a set of practices that has evolved over time.  From the earliest dissections of human corpses to the displays of digital cadavers on today's mobile devices, anatomy has changed how scientists observe the natural world, how medicine is practiced, and how we understand our own bodies.  Beginning with ancient Greek myths about wandering organs and ending with present-day exhibitions of plastinated cadavers (like Body Worlds), we will explore the ways anatomical knowledge and anatomical bodies have shaped and been shaped by social forces.  Our investigation into the science and culture of anatomy will be guided by readings, in-depth discussions, writing tasks, field trips, and the viewing of visual material (including a short film, a graphic novel, photography, x-rays, and anatomical illustrations).  Students are expected to enhance their skills at critical reading, thoughtful analysis, constructing logical arguments, and improving written communication. Fall 2012

adding:  129 FSNA Engineering Design for the World's Poorest Almost half (47%) of the people in Africa have incomes less than $1.25 per day. Most of these people live as subsistence farmers in small villages with no electricity, running water or automobiles (but with cell phones). This course will address ways that engineering solutions can improve their lives within these economic and practical constraints. A hands-on component of the course will involve designing and building affordable devices to meet specific needs. We have developed interactions with villages in Senegal and Botswana, and the engineering solutions will be explored within the context of the needs of such villages. Fall 2012

adding:  131 FSNA Stem Cells: The Science, Engineering, and Politics This course is a freshman seminar designed to introduce students to the science related to stem cells, the political controversies around stem cell research and application, and the engineering principles that can be used to direct stem cells to make tissues. The course will begin with an introduction to the science and terminology of stem cells. It will then focus on the various types including their isolation, growth, and potential. The course will draw on a variety of texts including newspaper articles, editorials, scientific journal articles, and general science interests articles to first understand the potential of the various types of stem cells and progenitors currently being investigated. There will be a hands on component to the course in which students will investigate the principles used to engineer environments to direct cells to make and repair tissue.

Science does not happen in a vacuum. Research regarding stem cells most certainly does not. The use of cells and the funding for stem cells are addressed by politicians, lobbyists, editors of newspapers, and religious leaders. We will consider the arguments made by the different groups in light of the deeper understanding of the current state of the research into the subject. Fall 2012

adding:  134 FSNA Fuel Cells Fuel Cells convert hydrogen and other fuels directly to electricity and are viewed as a key technology for non-polluting, oil-independent energy in the future.  In this course, we will study and critically analyze the prospects, technical and economic barriers, and impact of broad implementation of fuel cells, focusing on the transportation sector and portable power.  Major topics of the course include: (i) World and US energy outlook; (ii) Potential role and impact of fuel-cells; their advantages, principles of operation, design and materials issues, limitations and prospects for improvements; (iii) Special focus on details of a polymer type fuel cells (PEMFCs) for transportation and portable power; (iv) Modeling fuel cell performance and evaluation of controlling mechanisms that limit performance.  The course is designed for students from all disciplines.  Students will be expected to read assigned texts and articles and critically analyze statements and points of view presented.  Quantitative analysis will be encouraged and developed.  Student teams will develop a hypothesis to improve fuel cell performance by modifying the design of a component of the fuel cell.  The new component design with then be fabricated and tested in an operating prototype fuel cell.  Data analysis, hypothesis conclusion, and reporting of results are expected. Fall 2012

adding:  135 FSNA BioDesign Basics: The Art of Finding Patient Needs BioDesign basics explores the art of finding patient needs. No prior clinical or medical education is required in this seminar series, as we focus on acquiring and refining the underpinning critical thinking skills needed to identify and articulate unmet clinical (patient) needs. As an interactive and "hands-on" course, students will be engaged in discussions, events and activities to promote a first-hand understanding of "needs finding" to support individual mastery of writing and oral presentation skills. The Fourth Hour will be centered on "walking tours" of local medical institutions around University Circle. The course requires students to engage in written and oral communications as well as working in small teams to complete open-ended design/build-related assignments. The course will culminate in the design, fabrication and validation of a prototype product to meet an identified need. The design, fabrication and validation of these products will be carried out of think[box] 1.0 (Prentke-Romich Collaboratory), and the Reinberger Design Studio. Fall 2012

adding:  136 FSNA Saving the World from Poverty, Disease, Injustice and Environmental Exploitation Half of the world's population lives in poverty.  The causes of poverty and injustice are complex and the ramifications are numerous and serious and include grave risk to human health and to the environment.  Through reading, analysis, writing, and rigorous discussion the class will investigate issues surrounding poverty and disparities in health and opportunity.  We will also explore how innovation and engineering design can help address causes of poverty and disparity and meet needs of people at risk.  Design teams will work throughout the semester to identify an unmet need to engineer a solution to benefit an under-served or under-resourced population.  Fourth-hour activities will include interviewing knowledgeable stakeholders (locally and abroad via teleconference), learning about and volunteering with service organizations, and visiting local institutions and/or companies addressing these issues.

adding:  139 FSNA Systems Thinking and Problem Solving in Engineering, Policy Making, and Biomedicine With rapid technological advances and with the increasingly demanding competitiveness in the world economy, the challenges and complexities faced by engineers, biomedical researchers, managers, planners, and policy makers have become increasingly more difficult to understand, overcome and manage. Traditional scientific (reductionist) approaches have their limitations, particularly for dealing with issues that cut across multiple disciplines and require creative problem solving. Systems thinking is a framework of thought that helps us to view such complex problems in a holistic way through the "systems lens". Systems thinking is a mindset and set of (problem solving) tools. This course introduces students to the concept and practice of systems thinking, and demonstrates how it can be used for creative problem solving in engineering, energy, biology and medicine. The hands-on experience will be achieved through a project that will include "mess" analyzing, problem defining, model designing, model building, simulating, and output analyzing of a system/problem in engineering, energy, biology and medicine.

adding:  139 FSNA Systems Thinking and Problem Solving in Engineering, Policy Making, and Biomedicine With rapid technological advances and with the increasingly demanding competitiveness in the world economy, the challenges and complexities faced by engineers, biomedical researchers, managers, planners, and policy makers have become increasingly more difficult to understand, overcome and manage. Traditional scientific (reductionist) approaches have their limitations, particularly for dealing with issues that cut across multiple disciplines and require creative problem solving. Systems thinking is a framework of thought that helps us to view such complex problems in a holistic way through the "systems lens". Systems thinking is a mindset and set of (problem solving) tools. This course introduces students to the concept and practice of systems thinking, and demonstrates how it can be used for creative problem solving in engineering, energy, biology and medicine. The hands-on experience will be achieved through a project that will include "mess" analyzing, problem defining, model designing, model building, simulating, and output analyzing of a system/problem in engineering, energy, biology and medicine.

adding:  140 FSNA Critical Cartography: Making Sense of Place In this course we examine how different kinds of maps - both literal and metaphorical - shape the way we think about space and place. In turn, we ask how these concepts of space and place affect the way we alter and interact with the physical environment and with each other. Although the texts and places we examine this term will be diverse in subject, style, and form, we will attempt to unify our inquiry by returning to common questions: How does this text or place "map" certain values or political priorities? What other kinds of maps might be possible in this context? A strong emphasis will be placed on writing and thinking that is bother critical and imaginative. We borrow terms and concepts from geography and other fields, but our inquiry is open to many disciplines and interdisciplinary approaches. The formal writing will be analytical and argument-based. Through field trips and discussion, we will explore the Case Western environment, University Circle, and Cleveland more broadly. Fall 2012

adding:  142 FSNA Designed by Man, Built by Nature If you look at the structure of a human tendon, and at the reinforcement system in an automobile tire, they share many design elements in common. The eye of an octopus and a high performance surveillance lens can be similar as well. The structure of sea shell and of vehicular armor - again, these share common features. In this class we will examine how nature design things for performance, and how mankind copies these to produce useful objects. Two general introductions to technology will be supplemented with specific readings from the technical literature to provide a broad introductory background.
This writing-intensive seminar is tailored for incoming CWRU students with an interest in science, engineering and technology. Among other class activities this seminar will require the student to research, design and build prototype bio-inspired systems according to assignments made in class, with a competition held during the last week of the semester.

adding:  143 FSNA Materials and Energy Manufacturing and using the materials of modern life--metals, polymers, ceramics, paper products, and others--play major roles in the world's consumption of energy and natural resources.  This course will objectively and (when applicable) quantitatively explore the technological and social forces that drive current levels of materials usage.  Through readings, group discussions, writing assignments, and open-ended experiential learning activities, the course will address the following questions:  What are the scale and geographical distribution of materials usage?  How do the magnitude and impact of materials usage compare to those of other demands on energy and resources (such as agriculture, transportation, residential heating, and clean water)?  What are the impacts--positive and negative--of materials consumption on society and the natural environment?  How did the world get to its current situation, and what should, and can, be done in the future?  Students successfully completing this course will be able to think critically and objectively about the role of materials in society's use of energy and natural resources, and to articulate realistic, persuasive arguments based in quantifiable facts about these topics.

adding:  116 FSSO Working-Class Heroes This course will focus on the representation of the American laborer in literary and other cultural texts.  Beginning our study with mid-to-late nineteenth-century works, we will concentrate on how particularly American ideas about economics, race, and gender shape authors' depictions of working-class figures, reading both primary and secondary sources.  We will examine and discuss historical debates concerning the "hero in struggle" while paying special attention to rhetorics of protest and reform as informed by literary modes such as Sentimentalism, Naturalism, Realism, and Modernism.  Throughout the course, we will pair the literary and historical readings with pop-cultural representations of working-class figures, viewing films, listening to music, and analyzing visual arts both in class and on visits to Cleveland cultural institutions.  Writing Requirements include short critical response papers, two longer papers, and a final project accompanied by class presentations. Fall 2012

adding:  119 FSSO Philanthropy in America This four-credit course provides an introduction to various dimensions of philanthropy and volunteerism.  Using the seminar format and an array of interactive activities, we will conduct a broad but intellectual inquiry into the systems and ethics of giving time and money to charitable causes.  In four units of inquiry, we will consider the giving traditions that have influenced American culture and society since its colonial days.  We will examine the role that the Third Sector (also known as the Independent or Nonprofit Sector) plays as an agent of social change in a functioning democratic republic.  We will explore the nature of donors and volunteers and take a critical look at the missions and goals of a cross section of nonprofit organizations.  We will wrestle with ethical issues related to philanthropy and consider the giving patterns of different social, religious, and ethnic groups.  We will also turn our collective thinking to how the nonprofit sector might better serve the social needs of the nation and the world.  At the end of the semester, we will reflect on how our ideas about philanthropy have changed over the course of fifteen weeks. Fall 2012

adding:  120 FSSO Poverty and Social Policy This course has two major foci: poverty and social policies designed to ameliorate poverty. Sociologists in the United States and in other countries have made major contributions to studies of poverty. They have primarily focused on income-based poverty, but more recently, have also studied other forms of poverty. In this class, we will examine different conceptualizations and measures of poverty. We will then examine short-term and long-term poverty experiences and their potential consequences. We will then turn to explanations of poverty: why are some individuals more likely  to experience periods of low income than others? While the United States will be the focus of the course, we will contrast the experiences of other countries. The second component will be an analysis of social policies designed to ameliorate poverty. In particular, we will examine the development and retrenchment of welfare states and other social policies, the various goals of social policy, and the different impacts social policies have had on individuals, families, other groups, and the country overall. This discussion will reflect on experiences of other countries. Fall 2012

adding:  122 FSSO China in Modernization This four credit-hour course provides an introduction to various dimensions of modernization in contemporary China, especially cultural and social changes such as consumption, education, migration, and tourism as a result of economic reforms, trade expansion, foreign investments and technology transfer, especially the development of information technology.  The seminar will also asses the impacts of these changes on various aspects of globalization and vice versa.  It will be characterized by intense yet open-ended intellectual inquiry, guided by reading relevant material, and will include practice in written and oral communication in discussion forums and small groups.  The goals are to enhance basic intellectual skills of academic inquiry, such as critical reading, thoughtful analysis, and written and oral communication; to introduce basic information on literacy skills; to provide a foundation for ethical decision-making; to encourage a global and multidisciplinary perspective on the learning process; to facilitate faculty-student interactions; and, in the most general sense, to provide a supportive common intellectual experience at CWRU.

adding:  123 FSSO Ten Developments That Are Shaking The World This seminar is an introduction to some of the most important global developments of our times.  We will examine these events through political, historical, economic, cultural, sociological, scientific and ethical lenses.  Readings will come from a wide-range of sources, and assignments will include exercises in written and oral communication.  The professor will choose the first three global developments to be investigated as well as the relevant readings.  His topics will most likely be the proliferation of nuclear weapons, the rise of China as a great power and the fiftieth anniversary of the European Union.  Each of the remaining seven will be chosen by small groups of students, who will assign the readings and run the sessions for their respective topic.  Possible topics include the global food crisis, genocide and the failure of the world community to stop it, global warming and the growing gap between the world's rich and poor. Fall 2012

adding:  128 FSSO Movers and Shakers: Leadership "Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world.  Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has" (Margaret Mead, 1901-1978).  This seminar is about understanding what enables people to make a generative impact on the world.  Students will explore the socio-emotional and motivational characteristics of effective leaders and their ability to create positive change.  Students will also be encouraged to develop their own theories of leadership and to explore their personal approaches to making a difference.  The seminar will profile leaders from different occupations and walks of life.  Seminar sessions will feature assigned readings on leaders and change agents, class discussion on what drives movers and shakers, and individual and group presentations on class members' emergent leadership perspectives.

A key objective of the seminar is the development of critical thinking skills, writing skills, and verbal skills.  Consequently, the weekly class readings, reflection papers on class readings, class discussions, class presentations (individual and group), and final project are vital features of the seminar experience.  Students will be expected to leave the seminar with a grounded perspective on leaders and leadership, and the ability to articulate their own personal views on making a difference in the world.

adding:  142 FSSO The Simpsons and Modern Culture In this course we will explore the images and ideas that make up the world in which we live, using as our primary lens skewed (or possibly very clear) view of American culture constructed by more than two decades of The Simpsons.  By looking at cultural trends, technological advances, and social beliefs--and their expression through art, literature, technology, religion, and other forms--we can begin to come to terms with the world today.  The critical foundation of the course will be based on readings taken from a variety of sources, while the seemingly endless well of satire and irony produced by The Simpsons will provide a focus for our discussion.

Some of the questions we will ask include: Where do our notions of value come from?  How do our assumptions or expectations about society effect the way we live?  Where do the intangible boundaries that exist in our society come from, and how can we look beyond them to understand concepts like beauty, spirituality, and knowledge?  What happens when something is "fact" becomes "fiction"?  Can we--intellectually, spiritually, emotionally--transcend such categories? Fall 2012

adding:  143 FSSO Living With and Making Decisions Concerning Injustice Injustice. What do you think of when you hear that word? There are all types of injustice in this world, and chances are that during our lifetime we will either find ourselves in a position or system of power, perpetrating injusice on others; or in a position or system of supposed impotence, a subject of injustice. What are our choices? How will we respond? In this course we will examine the topic of living with and making decisions concerning injustice using, as an example, the specific injustice of slavery, examining the lives and decisions of both a famous slaveholder and two not-so-famous slaves; and learning from their lives and decisions how we might, ourselves, live with and make decisions concerning injustices we face in our lives.

adding:  144 FSSO Globalization and the U.S. No change in the last 20 years has altered our daily life more profoundly than globalization. This course examines its basic components - the flows of people, money, technology, and trade - as they spring from and return to the United States. Students will begin by examining the data in these areas, then progress to narratives about and personal reflections on the processes. They conclude the semester by taking a position in the larger debate about the effect of globalization. Fall 2012

adding:  112 FSSY Shakespeare - Still a Hit What is the enduring appeal of the works of William Shakespeare?  Not only are the plays themselves popular today; there are also many film versions and adaptations, some recent and some dating back to the early days of cinema.  In this First Seminar, students will read approximately six Shakespeare plays, including at least one history, comedy, and tragedy.  In addition, they will view at least one film version or adaptation of each play.  With the help of Kelvin Smith Library, the films will be made available on streaming video with password-protected access, enabling students to view them when convenient and as often as necessary.  Since this class (like all First Seminars) is writing-intensive, students will complete four formal essays as well as frequent in-class writing activities.  There will also be in-class readings from the plays, discussions of the various film adaptations, and one or two short oral presentations or activities. Fall 2012

adding:  113 FSSY Movies and Meaning This course explores methods for interpreting films.  To interpret a film is a more aggressive and creative activity than is simply viewing one.  How do critics and researchers of cinema  "make meaning"?  What strategies do they use?  How does one mount a film interpretation that is both novel and persuasive?  The course will emphasize close reading of films as, each week, we screen a film and together discuss what meanings we can infer from it.  Also each week, we'll read an essay that offers an interpretation of the film.  We'll analyze the reading in light of our sense of the film under consideration.  Students will write short essays, approximately one every two weeks, in which they analyze the rhetorical and interpretive strategies of a given film analysis.  Students will share their essays with the class, and these readings will serve as bases for class discussions.  Final writing projects will consist of student interpretations of a film.  At least twice during the semester, the class will, in substitution for the weekly required evening screening, attend a film off campus--either at the Cleveland Cinematheque or at the Cleveland Museum of Art.  The course emphasizes writing instruction and discussion in a seminar format.  There will be required evening screenings each week. Fall 2012

adding:  131 FSSY Death and Representation This four credit-hour course will explore the ways death has been represented in visual culture, from ancient times to the contemporary epoch.  Can death, something abstract and never directly experienced, ever be represented?  Throughout the ages, how have artists, patrons, and viewers influenced the imagery of death, and how, in turn, have they been influenced by it? The course includes multiple visits to the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Natural History Museum, and the Museum of Contemporary Art. Fall 2012

adding:  137 FSSY Cultural Representations: Ideologies, Images, and the World Narrative forms, such as myths, folktales, novels, films, and the media make significant contributions to the varied ways that people understand and imagine the spatial structures of the world. Specifically, this course will help you a) to develop an understanding of how narratives and the media have an impact on the ways we come to terms with geopolitical regions and how geopolitical regions are invented and imagined; b) to point out and address geopolitical assumptions, over-generalizations and to engage concepts such as the 'East' and 'West,' etc. critically; c) to analyze travel narratives, films, and current media representations of certain areas of the world and situate your observations into a wider set of theoretical problems; and d) to develop a set of reading skills that will help you to decipher texts(both primary and secondary) so that you can formulate productive questions and articulate your intellectual discoveries in a compelling way.

adding:  141 FSSY "Renaissance" Men and Women: Polymaths from Late Antiquity to Leonardo Da Vinci The term "Renaissance man" is often used to refer to a polymath, someone whose expertise spans numerous and diverse subject areas.  Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519), perhaps the most famous polymath of all, was an artist, scientist, engineer, musician, and indeed a man who lived during the Renaissance.  Yet already in late antiquity and the Middle Ages many of the great thinkers were polymaths, and they were not all men.  This course examines the intellectual contributions of Leonardo da Vinci and two earlier polymaths: Saint Augustine (390-430CE), a north African bishop, philosopher, and theologian who became a Doctor of the Church; and Hildegard of Bingen (1098-1179), a German nun who was a composer, philosopher, herbalist, and mystic visionary.  Through discussion of writings by these three figures and of secondary literature about them, the course explores their intellectual diversity and the cultural forces that shaped them.  It also examines what it meant to be a polymath at various points in history, why polymaths have become associated with the Renaissance and with men specifically, and why there are relatively few polymaths today.

adding:  142 FSSY Visions of Nature: Art and Landscape The natural world in its infinite complexity has long served as a vital subject for the visual arts. The seemingly intuitive genre of landscape painting contains evocative evidence of the intricate and ever changing relationship between humanity and the environment. In particular, during the nineteenth century, representations of the natural world in Europe and the United States achieved an even greater sense of urgency, as waves of industrialization and imperial expansion swept the globe bringing drastic social, political, and economic upheaval in their wake. Through a series of case studies, this course will explore the innumerable stories inscribed upon the landscape in nineteenth-century visions of nature. With extensive use of the collections of the Cleveland Museum of Art, we will look at the depiction of the natural world through a series of leading art movements, including Romanticism and Pre-Raphaelitism in Britain, Impressionism in France, and the sublime landscape tradition of the Western frontier in America. In order to help illuminate these works, we will read a variety of primary sources by authors such as Henry David Thoreau, John Ruskin, and Charles Baudelaire. Finally, we will extend this critical awareness to a consideration of our own attitudes towards the environment during a time of potential ecological crisis through the lens of contemporary artists like Andy Goldsworthy, Maya Lin, Alexis Rockman, and Chris Jordan. In addition to the Cleveland Museum of Art, this course will also incorporate numerous visits to the rich scientific, cultural and artistic institutions of University Circle. Fall 2012

adding:  143 FSSY The Ancient Romans and Us Since the mid-twentieth century and the ascendance of the United states of America as a superpower, historians and cultural critics have proclaimed that America is the New Rome. What does this mean? How and when did this comparison emerge? Ancient Rome was a great military power, but Rome also produced sensitive love poets, hilarious comic playwrights, and talented artists and architects. If America is the New Rome, does America also have writers and artists producing the same kinds of creative work and for the same reasons? In the political realm is there an American Cicero? Does American science have its Lucretius? The seminar will investigate selected ancient Roman works in literature, art, and material culture and look for meaningful similarities and differences between Roman and American civilizations. Along the way, the seminar will also see where, when, and how Roman civilization has influenced other postclassical civilizations, especially in Europe. Fall 2012

adding:  144 FSSY Thinking Through Literature What role can literature play in your intellectual life?  By extension, how does literature shape or contribute to institutions, societies, and cultures?  Why spend your valuable time and money reading fictional and imaginative works?  Why do we offer classes on novels, poems, and plays, and how could these works compete with the powerful and evolving products of science, technology, and the social sciences?  This seminar will attempt to answer these questions by approaching literature as an intellectual activity, something we do not merely think about (an object of analysis) but something that we think with (a mechanism for inquiry).  As we examine literature's active role in thinking, we will pay close attention to the way that it functions within the lives of individuals as well as public institutions and political communities; that is, we will reflect on the educational significance of literary reading and writing.  To conduct this inquiry, we will structure our seminar discussion around four categories: Imagination, ethics, creativity, and politics.  For each category, we will ask ourselves "how does literature help us think about this topic?"  As we explore these questions, we will read a number of short classic and contemporary statements on the merits (and problems) of literature. Fall 2012

Is there a "philosophy" behind the work of painters, photographers, or installation artists?  In this course, we will discuss the theoretical writings of some visual artists as well as philosophers' and sociologists' ideas about how art represents reality or provokes new experiences.  The course will involve field trips to University Circle museums and discussions with practicing visual artists and art specialists, including some specialists in non-Western art. Fall 2012

We will ask questions such as: Why do we fight cancer but mend broken bones? When (and how) do some experiences (e.g., sadness, hunger) become symptoms of disease? Why do doctors ask where it hurts rather than when or how? Is there a difference between saying that a patient is "med compliant" and that she has "taken her prescription medicines"? To answer these questions (and to ask dozens more), we will read primary research on medical language, visit several of Cleveland's nationally renowned cultural institutions, and discuss the symbolic and social meanings of a variety of medical terms, images, objects, and patterns of communication.

adding:  147 FSSY Art and Physics The twentieth century's advances in physics, from relativity to quantum mechanics and string theory, have offered distinctly new ways of looking at ourselves and the world around us.  It is no surprise that they have equally impacted different branches of the arts, revealing new possibilities for what to represent and how to represent it.  This course intends to explore this relationship between physics and art by taking two of those signal advances -- Albert Einstein's theory of relativity and Werner Heisenberg's uncertainty principle -- and considering how they inflect artistic models of expression such as painting (Cubism), music (atonal composition), and literature (postmodern metafiction).  Our goal is not to trace specific trains of influence (although they do exist) so much as to consider how parallel developments in the sciences and the arts emerge contemporaneously, and on that basis to reconstruct the conversation between them.  We will try to ask what each of these discursive models has to say to the others, and how the apparently unbridgeable gap between science and art might find some points of common contact. Fall 2012

adding:  148 FSSY American Dreams, Themes and Schemes This course will investigate the historical development of American identity and culture, paying particular attention to post-Civil War America. Since that war and even before, the question of what makes an American has been hotly debated by political figures, cultural intellectuals, and the general public. Do our democratic, public institutions define us as a people? How do our diverse cultural backgrounds and shared cultural institutions shape the American identity? We will investigate these questions by reading texts that ask one other, more fundamental question, the one Jean de Crevecoeur asked in his 1781 letters from an American Farmer: "What then is an American?" "Here individuals of all races," he famously continues, "are melted into a new race of man, whose labors and posterity will one day cause great changes in the world." Crevecoeur's "melting pot" certainly represents the dominant way of reading the American experience, and contemporary thinkers like Michael Walzer have argued in favor of his definition. The American melting pot, however, includes boiling struggles and conflicts. The process of becoming American is rarely easy. Hence, this course will examine the cultural struggles that appear in texts about sports like baseball, in historical experiences like westward expansion, in diverse yet underrepresented communities, and in musical forms of expression like rock and roll and jazz. Texts may include Jack Kerouac's On the Road, Harvey Pekar's American Splendor, Frederick Jackson Turner's thesis on westward expansion, and movies like The Searchers, Citizen Kane, and The Natural.

adding:  215 HSTY Europe in the 20th Century The twentieth century has seen stupendous transformations in the internal structures of European politics, economics, society, and culture and in Europe's place in the world. This course traces Europe's transition from a continent of sovereign nation-states or empires ruled by monarchs with starkly hierarchical social structures, through wars, revolution, dictatorships, destruction, division, and destitution, to a conflicted present. The contradictory combination of peace, freedom, and pluralism combined with cultural critique of the very consumer society that has reduced conflict challenges students' linear notions of historical development.

adding:  292 HSTY Energy and Environment in American History 1750-2010 This course uses the prism of energy to examine the history of the United States from the colonial period to the present.  We will consider how energy has affected, and is affected by, American society, culture, science and technology, politics, diplomacy, and the environment.  Four broad, thematic questions will recur throughout the semester.  First, how has increasing energy use transformed American social life, the economy, and politics?  Second, what are the relationships between energy consumption and environmental change?  Third, what are the relationships between scientific discoveries, technological innovation and social change?  And finally, how did the United States grow to be the largest consumer of energy in the history of the world?  Addressing these questions will reveal the fundamental ways in which energy has shaped American history. Fall 2012

adding:  338 HSTY History of the American West The U.S. West has meant many things throughout American history--early explorers called it the Great American Desert, railroad boosters lured settlers to it by promising to make the arid land bloom into an agricultural Eden, urban immigrants looked to its limitless stretches of land as an escape from industrial labor, children read dime novels that glorified its heroes, and millions of tourists celebrate its raw beauty by visiting Yellowstone, Yosemite, and the Grand Canyon.  The West has also been home diverse native societies for thousands of years, Asian immigrants who viewed it as an eastern frontier, women who struggled to feed their children in an arid land, and Latin Americans, whose ancestors often preceded the entry of White Americans.  This course introduces students to the themes, questions, and debates central to the study of the American west by drawing in primary source material and scholarly interpretations.  The goal of this course is to provide students with an understanding of the human history of the American west and the ability to express that history in clear, passionate writing and in-class discussion.` Fall 2012

adding:  380 HSTY The Sixties in America This course examines social, cultural, and political changes in the United States during the 1960s. We begin by examining the economic prosperity and "fragile" political consensus of the post-WWII period, as well as the undercurrent of poverty, dissent, and Cold War fears. We then cover the civil rights movement, student activism, the women's movement, the growth of Liberal America and the welfare state, the Vietnam War, the counterculture and conservative youth movements, the growth of a national consumer-driven, mass-mediated market, and the music, art, and pop culture--as well as their growing reliance on technological intervention--during this period of creative efflorescence. We will do this through reading books, but also through "reading" contemporary evidence of life in America, including listening to music, viewing films, analyzing pictures and artifacts. Fall 2012

adding:  425 IIME People Issues and Change in Organizations This course is intended to help students assess events occurring in organizations from a behavioral and human resources perspective and to help them develop strategies for managing these events. The course applies knowledge from the fields of organizational behavior and human resource management to provide an understanding and the skills needed to be effective in organizations.  The fields of Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management are devoted to the study of how human beings act in organized settings and how organizations can affect human behavior through a variety of policies, practices, structures, and strategies. In today's environment, organizations are faced with high levels of international competition and an increasing pace of technological, market, and social changes.  As an organizational member, you are expected to successfully operate within these increasingly complex demands as well as help create and guide change.  The purpose of this course is to provide you with the framework and tools needed to analyze and operate in the changing organization.  We will examine some of the features that characterize an emerging organizational form and contrast this to its traditional predecessor.  The focus of the course will be on the skills you will need to operate in the "new" organization including skills for being a change agent working in entry level and early career managerial roles. Recommended preparation: Accredited Bachelor's in Engineering plus summer job experience. Fall 2012

adding:  440 IIME Six Sigma and Quality Management The Six Sigma process is the standard for quality improvement in organizations around the globe.  In this course, we study the details of the five steps in the Six Sigma process: DEFINE, MEASURE, ANALYZE, IMPROVE, and CONTROL (DMAIC).  We introduce the concept of sustainability into the criteria to use to evaluate proposed solutions during the Six Sigma process.  Many tools, concepts, and processes that are often an integral part of Six Sigma projects in companies are included in the course content.  They range from the very basic tools of quality (such as cause-and-effect diagrams for brainstorming) to complete processes (such as benchmarking, quality function deployment, failure mode and effects analysis-FMEA).  Statistical concepts that are central to Six Sigma including statistical process control and introduction design of experiments are also included.  Once the Six Sigma process and its various components are understood, we study quality management including quality control, quality planning, quality improvement, strategic quality management, and quality strategy.  Students meeting the required standards of performance will earn a Green Belt Certification in Six Sigma and Quality Management from the Weatherhead School of Management. Fall 2012

adding:  473 IIME Fundamentals of Clinical Information Systems Technology has played a significant role in the evolution of medical science and treatment.  While we often think about progress in terms of the practical application of, say, imaging to the diagnosis and monitoring of disease, technology is increasingly expected to improve the organization and delivery of healthcare services, too.  Information technology plays a key role in the transformation of administrative support systems (finance and administration), clinical information systems (information to support patient care), and decision support systems (managerial decision-making).  This introductory graduate course provides the student with the opportunity to gain insight and situational experience with clinical information systems (CIS).  Often considered synonymous with electronic medical records, the "art" of CIS more fundamentally examines the effective use of data and information technology to assist in the migration away from paper-based systems and improve organizational performance.  In this course we examine clinical information systems in the context of (A) operational and strategic information needs, (B) information technology and analytic tools for workflow design, and (C) subsequent implementation of clinical information systems in patient care.  Legal and ethical issues are explored.  The student learns the process of "plan, design, implement" through hands-on applications to select CIS problems, while at the same time gaining insights and understanding of the impacts placed on patients and health care providers.

adding:  1801 LAWS Core 1: Research, Writing, and Skills This course is the first of a sequence of required courses in the CaseArc Program which trains students in the fundamental skills of practicing law. Students are introduced to the fundamentals of legal analysis and rhetoric beginning with objective written legal analysis.

adding:  441 MATH Mathematical Modeling Mathematics is a powerful language for describing real world phenomena and providing predictions that otherwise are hard or impossible to obtain.  The course gives the students pre-requisites for translating qualitative descriptions given in the professional non-mathematical language into the quantitative language for mathematics.  While the variety in the subject matter is wide, some general principles and methodologies that a modeler can pursue are similar in many applications.  The course focuses on these similarities.  The course is based on representative case studies that are discussed and analyzed in the classroom, the emphasis being on general principles of developing and analyzing mathematical models.  The examples will be taken from different fields of science and engineering, including life sciences, environmental sciences, biomedical engineering and physical sciences.  Modeling relies increasingly on computation, so the students should have basic skills for using computers and programs like Matlab or Mathematica. Fall 2012

adding:  400 MMED Research Rotations Research rotations are conducted to expose the student to several laboratory environments, a variety of research problems and numerous laboratory techniques as well as to assist them in the selection of their Research Advisor.  Rotations will begin immediately upon enrollment and continue through the second semester of the first year.  Usually rotations will last 12 weeks, however if a student decides that he/she is not interested in the assigned laboratory a shorter rotation is appropriate.  The student is responsible for arranging each rotation with an approved trainer with the consultation of the Graduate Program Director.  To assist in this endeavor, the Graduate Program Director will provide a list of approved trainers who have space, time and money to support a graduate student.  During the rotation, students are expected to participate in all lab and departmental activities, e.g., lab meetings and seminars. At the completion of a rotation the student is required to submit a written Rotation Report including an outline of the problem being studied, a description of the experimental approaches, a discussion of the results of performed experiments as well as future directions.

The emphases of ARM2 Friday Research Seminar is on the content of the research and how this research may impact and change clinical practice in the future.  Each week, a student from the class will be assigned to moderate the session.  The student moderator will introduce the speaker and will be responsible for assuring that adequate interactive discussion occurs.  In addition, four sets of 2-week sessions each will be devoted to small group sessions.  The goal of the 2-week sessions is for the students to develop a research plan directly related to the organ system featured in the presentations. Fall 2012

adding:  521 MMED Molecular aspects of the diagnosis, pathology, and treatment of selected human diseases The goal of this course is to integrate medical knowledge into PhD training.  This team-taught seminar course focuses on a top down examination of selected human diseases starting with clinical presentations of the manifestations, diagnoses, and treatment of disease.  This is followed by study of the pathology, cell biology, and molecular biology of the disease.  This information forms the foundation of a final discussion of current treatment strategies and ongoing research to identify new strategies.  Three to four separate disease areas will be discussed during each semester, such as neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, cardiovascular diseases and others.  The specific areas of discussion are selected to demonstrate the strength of an integrated team of clinical and basic scientists; and to provide a model for students to follow in future studies in their own area of expertise.  Emphasis will be given to the basic scientific observations that formed the basis of successful clinical practice, and how this was utilized by integrated teams of basic and clinical investigators to provide better patient care.  Students will prepare for discussions with close reading of the literature.  Faculty will present an overview in a discussion format.  It is anticipated that each disease area will be presented by an integrated team of clinical and basic scientists.  The final weeks of the semester will be devoted to student preparation of a research proposal based upon the information discussed during the course.  The specific topic of this proposal will be of the students choosing.  Grading will be based both upon preparation for and participation in discussions, and upon the research proposal.

adding:  612 MMED Clinical Experience Each student will be assigned a Clinical Mentor who will co-advise the student and serve on both the Qualifying Examination Committee and Thesis Committee. The Clinical Mentor will develop an individualized curriculum for the student in consultation with the Thesis Research Mentor and Program Director. The curriculum will be organized around the integrated, multidisciplinary disease groups at the Clinic. The students will attend and actively participate in the regularly scheduled multidisciplinary clinical conference organized by their disease group (most meet for one hour every week or every other week), usually involving a combination of case presentations and research presentations. At the conclusion of the semester the student will make a presentation to the group focused on a relevant translational research problem. The Clinical Mentor will also organize a series of supervised clinical experiences (with a Mentor) to various locations where students will observe clinician interactions with patients to better understand the disease from the patient perspective and to disease-related diagnostic and research laboratories.

While the course begins with dialogue, it will end with specific activities (performed by the students and community together) to improve community health, and a logic model for evaluating and expanding those activities. As reflection is a critical skill for leadership, the experiences in community organizing and advocacy will be counterposed with reflection on learning and will include independent reading and writing and small group discussions. Readings about leadership, advocacy and community health (particularly in cities) will include diverse perspectives and genre including work from Lao Tzu, Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., Shakespeare, Saul Alinsky and others.

adding:  652 MPHP Public Health Capstone Experience Public health field practicum, involving a placement at a community-based field site, and a Master's essay.  The field placement will provide students with the opportunity to apply the knowledge and skills acquired through their Master of Public Health academic program to a problem involving the health of the community.  Students will learn to communicate with target groups in an effective manner; to identify ethical, social, and cultural issues relating to public health policies, research, and interventions; to identify the process by which decisions are made within the agency or organization; and to identify and coordinate use of resources at the placement site.  The Master's essay represents the culminating experience required for the degree program and may take the form of a research thesis, an evaluation study, or an intervention study.  Each student is required to formally present the experience and research findings.  In any semester in which a student is registered for MPHP 652 credit, it is required that the student attend the Community Health Research and Practice (CHRP) group at a minimum of two sessions per 3 credits.  CHRP is held once a week for approximately an hour and a half for the duration of fall, spring, and summer semesters.  MPHP 652 credit is available only to Master of Public Health students. Fall 2012

adding:  413 MPOD Foundations of Positive Organization Development and Change This course explores and develops the art of reading and understanding social systems in ways that help us imagine, design and develop organization excellence.  First it seeks to show how many of our conventional ideas about organizations are based on discourse and metaphors that lead us to see and understand organizations in partial and often limiting ways.  Growing research from the domains of Positive Psychology and Positive Organization Scholarship and the theory and practice of Appreciative Inquiry will be explored to show how we can create new and more positive, strength-based ways of designing and developing social systems.  Includes presentations, guest lectures and panel discussions on current topics of interest for the Masters in Positive Organization Development and Change (MPOD) candidates.  Led by a faculty member of the Department of Organization Behavior, these dialogues and seminars will be presented in several of the six main residencies of the MPOD program.  Reflective essays and integrative papers will enable participants to explore their practice of OD, leadership capacity, application of learnings from the program and deeply held values related to current issues and opportunities in the domain of human systems change and development.

adding:  421 MSFI Fundamental Analysis of Companies and Industries The goal of this course is twofold--to revisit important concepts in financial and managerial accounting, marketing, strategy and operations, and to see how they can be applied through the filter of finance.  Put a little differently, what should students think about above and beyond analyzing accounting and financial information in assessing how value gets created within the firm?  While students may have been exposed to some of these subjects in their undergraduate studies, this course will ensure they all have a common background and language.

We will rely heavily on working with financial information from a broad range of companies and industries.  Emphasis will be placed on understanding the key drivers behind financial results--what choices about business model and business strategy lead to the reported financial results. Fall 2012

The course concerns modern econometric topics like time-series forecasting, volatility modeling, and panel data analysis. Various concepts and approaches in the course will be subjected to real world data. Students are expected to have basic knowledge of the fundamentals of corporate finance and statistics. The course aims at providing a lasting conceptual framework for model building using modern applied econometric techniques commonly employed in finance. Fall 2012

adding:  406 MSOR Operations Management for MSM OR Operations managers, ranging from supervisors to vice presidents, are concerned with the production of goods and services.  More specifically, they are responsible for designing, running, controlling and improving the systems that accomplish production.  This course is a broad-spectrum course with emphasis on techniques helpful to the practice of management at the analyst level.  Its goal is to introduce you to the environments, to help you appreciate the problems that operations managers are confronted with, and provide you with the tools to address these problems.  Operations Management spans all value-adding activities of an organization including product and process design, production, service delivery, distribution network and customer order management.  As global competition in both goods and services increases, a firm's survival depends upon how well it structures its operations to respond quickly to changing consumer needs.  Thus, it is essential for all business managers to acquire an understanding of operations management to maintain their competitive advantage.  This course provides students with the basic tools needed to become an analyst in Supply Chain and Operations Management.  This course provides an overview of Process analysis, Capacity management, Queuing system, analysis, Forecasting, Quality management, Material Requirements planning, Inventory management, and Supply Chain management.  The emphasis of the course is on both real world applications and technical problem solving.  Several manufacturing and non-manufacturing environments will be discussed explicitly, like health care, insurance, hotel-management, airlines and government related operations.  Also we will explore the interface of operations management with other functional areas such as marketing, finance, accounting, etc.  This coursework includes individual and group assignments, case analyses and experiential learning through simulations and educational games.

adding:  410 MSOR Financial Management for Supply Chain This course focuses on learning the language of business, how basic accounting information is reported and analyzed, and how basic financial principles can be applied to understanding how value is created within an enterprise.  This course is intended for individuals who have a limited background in accounting, finance and business.  Most of the exercises will involve evaluating and building models in Excel.  Teaching objectives are fairly straightforward: 1. Provide you with a basic understanding of the key principles of accounting and finance.  We will quickly cover material that is typically covered in a three-course sequence (Introductory Accounting and Finance I and II).  We will fly at a fairly high level, but we want to make sure you understand the basic concepts.  2. Apply these concepts to real (but straightforward) business situations, to gain a better understanding of how companies utilize accounting and financial information.  3. Time permitting, explore how these concepts can be applied to securities, mergers and acquisitions and leveraged buyout transactions, with a specific emphasis on how these concepts are likely to surface in your role in such transactions.

adding:  420 OPMT Six Sigma and Quality Management The Six Sigma process is the standard for quality improvement in organizations around the globe.  In this course, we study the details of the five steps in the Six Sigma process: DEFINE, MEASURE, ANALYZE, IMPROVE, and CONTROL (DMAIC).  We introduce the concept of sustainability into the criteria to use to evaluate proposed solutions during the Six Sigma process.  Many tools, concepts, and processes that are often an integral part of Six Sigma projects in companies are included in the course content.  They range from the very basic tools of quality (such as cause-and-effect diagrams for brainstorming) to complete processes (such as benchmarking, quality function deployment, failure mode and effects analysis-FMEA).  Statistical concepts that are central to Six Sigma including statistical process control and introduction design of experiments are also included.  Once the Six Sigma process and its various components are understood, we study quality management including quality control, quality planning, quality improvement, strategic quality management, and quality strategy.  Students meeting the required standards of performance will earn a Green Belt Certification in Six Sigma and Quality Management from the Weatherhead School of Management. Fall 2012

adding:  450 OPMT Project Management Project management is concerned with the management and control of a group of interrelated tasks required to be completed in an efficient and timely manner for the successful accomplishment of the objectives of the project. Since each project is usually unique in terms of task structure, risk characteristics and objectives, the management of projects is significantly different from the management of repetitive processes designed to produce a series of similar products or outputs. Large-scale projects are characterized by a significant commitment of organizational and economic resources coupled with a high degree of uncertainty. The objective of this course is to enhance the ability of participants to respond to the challenges of large-scale projects so that they can be more effective as project managers. We study in detail up-to-date concepts, models, and techniques useful for the evaluation, analysis, management, and control of projects. Fall 2012

adding:  411 OPRE Optimization Modeling The first half of the course provides a practical coverage of linear programming, a special type of mathematical model.  The art of formulating linear programs is taught through the use of systematic model-building techniques.  The simplex algorithm for solving these models is developed from several points of view: geometric, conceptual, algebraic, and economic.  The role and uses of duality theory are also presented.  Students learn to obtain and interpret a solution from a computer package and how to use the associated output to answer "What-happens-if..." questions that arise in post-optimality analysis.  Specific topics include: problem formulation, geometric and conceptual solution procedures, the simplex algorithm (phase 1 and phase 2), obtaining and interpreting computer output, duality theory, and sensitivity analysis.  The second half of this course provide a practical approach to formulating and solving combinatorial optimization problems in the areas of networks, dynamic programming, project management (CPM), integer programming, and nonlinear programming.  The art of formulating problems, understanding what is involved in solving them, and obtained and interpreting the solution from a computer package are shown.  A comparison with formulating and solving linear programming problems is provided as a way to understand the advantages and disadvantages of some of these problems and solutions procedures.  Recommended preparation: Knowledge of Excel, one semester each of undergraduate linear algebra and undergraduate calculus (derivatives); or consent of instructor. Fall 2012

adding:  433 OPRE Probability, Statistics, and Forecasting Data of many kinds are typically available in practice, but the challenge is to use those data to make effective professional decisions.  This software-intensive course begins with useful descriptions of data and the probability theory foundation on which statistics rests.  It continues to statistics, including the central limit theorem, which explains why data often appear to be normally distributed, and the Palm-Khintchine theorem which explains why data often appear to have a Poisson distribution.  The remainder of the course focuses on regression and forecasting, including detecting and overcoming some of the deadly sins of regression, and the surprising flexibility of regression models.

How do the effective ones think and act? What situations create leaders, foster their emergence or provide opportunities? What makes us want to follow them? What are the personal pits of being a leader (i.e., sex, drugs, alcohol, insomnia, ulcers, etc.)? How are leaders developed? Case studies, self-study and at-work projects will be the primary methods used in the course. Fall 2012

adding:  481 PHOL Medical Physiology I Physiology is the dynamic study of life.  It describes the vital functions of living organisms and their organs, cells, and molecules.  For some, physiology is the function of the whole person.  For many practicing clinicians, physiology is the function of an individual organ system.  For others, physiology may focus on the cellular principles that are common to the function of all organs and tissues.  Medical physiology deals with how the human body functions, which depends on how the individual organ systems function, which depends on how the component cells function, which in turn depends on the interactions among subcellular organelles and countless molecules.  Thus, it requires an integrated understanding of events at the level of molecules, cells, and organs.  Medical Physiology I is a lecture course (3, 2 hr. lectures/week).  It is the first of a two-part, comprehensive survey of physiology that is divided into four blocks: Block 1 covers the physiology of cells and molecules, signal transduction, basic electrophysiology, and muscle physiology; Block 2 covers the nervous system; Block 3 covers the cardiovascular system, and; Block 4 covers the respiratory system.  Grading in the course will be based on performance on multiple choice/short essay examinations administered at the end of each block with each examination weighted according to the number of lectures contained in that block.

adding:  483 PHOL Translational Physiology I Physiology is the dynamic study of life, describing the vital functions of living organisms and their organs, cells, and molecules.  For some, physiology is the function of the whole person.  For many practicing clinicians, physiology is the function of an individual organ system.  For others, it focuses on the cellular principles that are common to the function of all organs and tissues.  Medical physiology deals with how the human body functions, which depends on how the individual organ systems function, which depends on how the component cells function, which in turn depends on the interactions among subcellular organelles and countless molecules.  Translational Physiology I will explore examples of how the latest basic research in physiology and biophysics is being applied to the treatment of human disease.  For example, while the students are studying the basic principles of cardiovascular physiology, they will also be investigating how these principles are being applied to treat/cure human cardiovascular disorders such as congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, etc.  Translational Physiology I is a lecture course (1, 2 hr lecture/week) taught primarily by clinical faculty.  It is the first of a two-part course that follows the topics being simultaneously covered in the Medical Physiology I course.  It is divided into four blocks: Block I covers the physiology of cells and molecules, signal transduction, basic electrophysiology, and muscle physiology; Block 2 covers the nervous system; Block 3 covers the cardiovascular system; and Block 4 covers the respiratory system.  Grading in the course will be based on performance on multiple choice/short essay examinations administered at the end of each block with each examination weighted according to the number of lectures contained in that block.

adding:  315 PHRM Nuclear Receptors in Health and Disease This course focuses on hormone-gene interactions mediated by the ligand-inducible transcription factors termed nuclear hormone receptors.  The class will address the mechanisms of action, regulatory features, and biological activities of several nuclear receptors.  The usage of nuclear receptors as therapeutic targets in disease states such as cancer, inflammation, and diabetes will also be discussed.  The course aims to teach students to critically evaluate primary literature relevant to nuclear hormone receptors biology, and to reinforce presentation/discussion skills.  Grades for undergraduates will be based on midterm, final exam; grades for graduates will be based on midterm, final exam, and presentation of a recently published research article related to the role of nuclear receptors in health and disease.
Offered as PHRM 315, BIOC 315, PHRM 415 and BIOC 415. Fall 2012

adding:  402 PHRM Principles of Pharmacology II: The Molecular Basis of Therapeutics This course focuses on human physiology of organ systems that are involved in determining the time course of drug action in vivo (pharmacokinetics). Emphasis will be placed on fundamental principles of pharmacokinetics, including the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of drugs. Mathematical concepts needed to understand appropriate administration of drugs and maintaining therapeutic concentrations of drugs in the body will be discussed. A second broad area of emphasis is on fundamental principles of drug action within the body (pharmacodynamics), including drug-receptor theory, log dose-response relationships, therapeutic index, receptor turnover, and signal transduction mechanisms. This is a highly interactive course in which faculty lectures are minimized and student-directed learning in emphasized. An animal laboratory explores the actions of cardiovascular drugs in an in vivo setting. This 3-credit hour course meets 6 hours per week mid-February through April. Fall 2012

adding:  232 RLGN DESI: Diaspora, Ethnicity, Southasia(n), Interrogate In this class we will interrogate the cultural Identity(ies) and imagined community(ies) of the "South Asian" Diaspora.  We will first examine taxonomy and categorization itself, as a methodical, philosophical, and political enterprise.  We will then examine how such contrived categories have been applied to the so-called desis, loosely and broadly understood as members of the South Asian Diaspora.  To this end we will scrutinize the development of American(ized)) "Hinduism." the imagined location that desis have in North American racial and ethnic hierarchies, and the construction of assimilated, enculturated, and transnational imagined desi communities.

adding:  313 RLGN Topics in Biblical Literature: A departmental "topics" seminar focused on advanced textual analysis and interpretation of particular biblical (including apocryphal) texts and the critical issues of method, theory, theology, and history that pertain to those texts.  Reading assignments will be divided between close, exegetical analysis of small units of texts and the study of scholarly criticism of the same texts (commentaries, journal articles, critical notes).  Evaluation will be based on class preparation and participation, weekly short papers, an exegetical paper focused on a particular pericope of the student's choice, and an interpretive paper based on exegesis of several related passages.
Graduate students enrolled in the course as RLGN 413 will have the following additional requirements:(a) preliminary academic reading on the biblical material; (b) leadership/teaching of one seminar session on an academic theoretical or theological approach to the biblical text, including an additional meeting with the professor in preparation for that session; and (c) a longer final paper that critical engages the approach that was the focus of the seminar session s/he leads (15-20 pages, suitable for publication at an academic conference).

adding:  355 SASS Drugs and Youth Drug abuse is a more acute problem and more widespread than in any previous era of our country.  Just as technology continues to evolve, drug use follows similar paths of evolution.  Today, there are thousands of new drugs available that are used for medicinal purposes, recreational purposes, and other uses that affect the health of our citizens.  The impact of drug use and/or abuse on the lives of ordinary people with be explored both through academic readings as well as biographies of young people who have dealt with the problem of drug abuse.  Material will be presented from a wide range of disciplines and theoretical perspectives highlighting the bio-psycho-social nature of the problem--both the etiology as well as the effects of addiction.  The impact of both macro (society) and micro (family and friends) on drug use of both licit (alcohol, over the counter drugs, and prescription) and illicit (marijuana, hallucinogens, and cocaine) on various subcultures such as sports/athletics, college students, women, adolescents, etc. will be explored.  Course content will be covered via lectures, classroom discussions as well as appropriate guest speakers. Fall 2012

adding:  440 SASS Human Development I: Child and Adolescent This course offers an overview of normal individual development throughout the life cycle. Psychosocial theory, learning theories, and social role theory constitute the theoretical base for this foundation course. Developmentally determined objectives and tasks for every life stage are examined in the context of biological, genetic, psychological, familial, and sociocultural factors. Special emphasis is placed on the impact of gender, health, and minority status, and on community institutions of human development. This course supports the foundation social work methods course by introducing substantive content on human development as a framework for assessment, prevention, and intervention with psychosocial problems. Curricularly related to the advanced sociobehavioral courses on human development and developmental dysfunction, this course provides a basic understanding of normal human development, which can serve as a contextual framework for developmental deviations from the norm.

adding:  564 SASS Social Work Practice in Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse SASS 564 is an advanced direct practice concentration course focused upon knowledge, skills and values important for social work practice with people who abuse and/or are dependent on alcohol and other drugs.  The content of SASS 564 directly builds upon the foundation direct practice course (SASS 477) and the required advanced course in screening and assessment (SASS 576).  SASS 564 takes a bio-psycho-social approach to prevention, assessment and treatment of alcohol and other drug abuse and dependency (AODA) problems.  This course introduces the student to the etiology and treatment of alcohol and other drug abuse in the context of social work practice.  The historical background and the development of the evidence base of alcohol and other drug treatment interventions, self-help groups, and conceptual models of addiction will be presented.  Students will explore their own attitudes and values toward AODA problems and how these affect treatment outcome as well as commonly used prevention and treatment approaches in social work with people who abuse and/or are dependent upon alcohol and other drugs.  The course will use case materials to illustrate similarities and differences among various populations including minority/ethnic identity groups. Fall 2012

adding:  565 SASS Community-Based Practice with Children and Families This course covers knowledge, concepts, and tools associated with contemporary child welfare practice. The practice method reflects a family centered or family based approach, meaning that the welfare of children cannot be considered separately from the families of which they are a part. For each topic area, major social work roles, activities, tasks and skills are explored along with problems and issues in implementation. Program exemplars and case studies are presented for illustration purposes and practical application of the skills and techniques presented. Child welfare services that promote safety, permanency, and child well-being are presented. Consideration of family needs at different developmental stages of the child and family life cycle are also presented. The issue of culturally competent community based social work practice is stressed throughout the course for each content area. While this is primarily a methods course, program delivery and policy issues are discussed as they relate to the socio-political and organizational contexts of practice. Fall 2012

adding:  275 SOCI Lives in Medicine: Becoming and Being a Physician This course applies a sociological approach to medical profession.  Medical sociology emerged as a distinct field of study in the 1950s in part due to prominent studies of medical education such as The Student Physician by Robert K. Merton and Howard Becker's Boys in White.  Since then, sociologists and other social scientists have written extensively about how issues of race, gender, aging and ethnicity are tied to issues of medical education, medical training, medical socialization and physician decision-making.  Using a life course perspective, this course will examine how lives in medicine change over time; in particular, we'll study changing workforce patterns, physician satisfaction, and burnout.  Other topics to be covered include contemporary ethical issues and alternative professional health careers.  The course provides an overview of how medicine and medical practice have a profound influence on--and are influenced by---social, cultural, political and economic forces.  In short, you'll become familiar with how scholars outside of medicine cast a sociological gaze on the profession. Fall 2012

adding:  300 SOCI Modern Sociological Thought The most profound commentary of industrial society began in the middle of the nineteenth century with thinkers such as Durkheim, Marx, and Max Weber. Students will read the work of these scholars as it appeared in the original sources. They thoughtfully address concepts such as social integration and alienation, crime and punishment, and the social impact of modernization. The course is of special relevance to students in the social sciences, but is also recommended for students in other fields who wish to understand the social context in which professional lives will be conducted.

adding:  501 SYBB Biomedical Informatics and Systems Biology Journal Club The purpose of this journal club is to provide an opportunity for students to critically discuss a wide variety of informatics and systems biology topics and to present their works in progress.  A wide range of informatics and systems theory approaches to conducting biomedical research will be accomplished through the guided selection of articles to be discussed during the club.  Potential articles will be chosen from scientific journals including: Nature, Science, BMC Bioinformatics, BMC Systems Biology, the Journal of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, and the Journal for Biomedical Informatics.  During journal presentations, trainees will be expected to lead a discussion of the article that leads to the critical evaluation of the merit of the article and its implication for biomedical informatics and systems biology.  The Journal Club will also provide a forum for trainees to present proposed, on-going, and completed research.  Trainees will attend and participate in the Journal Club throughout their tenure in the program.  The Journal Club will meet twice a month and each trainee will be required to present one journal article and one research in progress presentation yearly.  The Journal Club will also include sessions where issues related to the responsible conduct of research are reviewed and extended. Fall 2012

adding:  390 THTR Theater Design and Technology Capstone This is a SAGES Capstone course designed to provide an opportunity for advanced Design/Technical Theater Undergraduates to undergo a thorough theatrical design experience as would expected in the professional theater.  The project requires a specific play or performance piece to be chosen or assigned and researched thoroughly.  The research would culminate in a production concept which should be presented in written and oral form with a great deal of visual support.  The production concept leads to the design, either scenic, costume, lighting or sound, which then must be executed.  In professional theater, execution first means preparing all of the drafting, renderings, and paperwork necessary for a production team to create the set or costumes, or prepare the necessary lighting or sounds equipment in the venue.  The final portion of the design execution will be the performance of the actual piece on stage.  It could be appropriate for a scenic or costume design project to be complete at this stage as the vast majority of the work must be done before the actual performance and the realization of the design is executed by a production team.  Lighting and sounds designers must finish the execution of their designs in the technical rehearsal phase of production.  Their work is dependent on integration with the other elements of production.  However, theater is a collaborative art form, and the final execution of every design on stage is the ultimate goal of the designers, and when possible, it would be preferable to have every capstone project culminate in a fully realized production.  Due to budget constraints and the logistics of allowing every design/technical senior to be able to participate in a fully realized production, students can choose to pursue a more research intensive project in which the student could study specific designers, movements in design or the development of technology in theatrical design.  These projects would be presented in a more traditional oral presentation with visual support. Fall 2012

adding:  395 UCAP SAGES Capstone Experience UCAP 395 affords students the opportunity to pursue a capstone experience outside the constraints of SAGES capstone courses offered by individual academic departments. Students must identify a project, a mentor and an oversight committee. If the mentor is not a Case faculty member, then the student must also identify a faculty advisor who does hold such an appointment and who will serve as the instructor of record. A capstone experience can take various forms but must include certain elements: critical thinking, regular oversight by the project advisor(s), periodic written and oral reporting of progress, a final written report which describes the project activity (which may be a performance, experiment, student teaching, live case analysis, creative writing endeavor, etc.), and a final public presentation.  More details about course policies, including procedures for registering, are available via the SAGES office and web site.  UCAP 395 may be taken as a one-semester or a two-semester course for 1-6 credits in any given semester and 3-6 credits total.  Permit from Director of SAGES required. Fall 2012

adding:  204 USNA The Evolution of Scientific Ideas Scientific understanding has evolved over the years. There are very few beliefs about the natural world that have remained intact over the past few centuries, or even the past few decades. The chief goal of the course will be to give students an understanding of how scientific ideas change and how newer ideas supersede the old. Questions to be investigated include: What is Science? How do disciplinary scientific communities (physicists, chemists, biologists, etc.) form and identify themselves? How does the community of scientists within a discipline come to a consensus that it is time to adopt a new paradigm: What scientific, social, political, and cultural factors come into play during the periods of transition? The course will be in seminar format. The students will be given opportunities to explicitly develop critical thinking skills (the specific skills to be developed will be selected by the class from an explicit list) and writing and speaking skills. Class meetings will be used to share their research results and to study the assigned texts and papers. The students will be required to demonstrate their understanding in a variety of ways.

adding:  226 USNA Evolution of Human Behavior Human behavior is a result of the complex interplay between our genes and the environment, both of which have been shaped by evolutionary forces over millions of years.  To what extent does natural selection shape our behavior today?  Are humans naturally monogamous?  Why do conflicts arise even in our most intimate relationships?  Is human behavior ultimately in the service of reproductive success, ensuring that our genes are passed into the next generation?  This course reviews the history of evolutionary theories of mind and behavior, as well as current ideas about the ecological and genetic components of behavior.  We will examine key principles of neurobiology, sociobiology, and evolutionary psychology to critically evaluate evolutionary interpretations of human behaviors, including those comprising cultural traditions and social institutions.  Specific topics to be addressed include human mate choice, parenting strategies, interpersonal conflict, and altruism.  The course is structured as a seminar, with emphasis on discussion and formation of logical arguments. Fall 2012

adding:  237 USNA Landscape History and Conservation Human history is intimately intertwined with the natural landscape on which it occurred.  From coastal preserves and their beach communities to Midwestern farmland and the preserved site of Thoreau's Walden Pond cabin, and at places like the Grand Canyon, the American landscape itself holds many clues to our country's natural, ecological, and cultural history.  This course will investigate the lived landscape in two ways (which have a multitude of shades to them):  as a place where humans shape the natural for their own memorial, productive, and aesthetic uses, or as a natural place that humans set aside or conserve.  We will read landscape history and conservation theory, and we will consider global practices of conservation through UNESCO's World Heritage Sites.  Class work will entail a process-oriented project on the Cleveland landscape, which students are encouraged to approach through the lens of their major.  We will visit the Wade Oval and the cultural gardens of Rockefeller Park as an example of current conservation practices working to protect the natural and cultural value of the local landscape.

adding:  247 USNA Epidemics in Human History This course will examine the role of epidemics (of all types) in human history.  Disease has shaped our society in many ways and continues to do so.  Despite the plethora of antibiotic and antiviral drugs since 1940, 90% of the decrease in (First World) infectious disease is due to simple public health measures and better hygiene.  But overuse of antibiotics increasingly is causing the rapid evolution of "superbugs" that threaten new plagues and epidemics.  Both historical and modern epidemics of plague, smallpox, Salmonella, cholera, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS will be examined.  The interaction of these epidemics with societies and how the epidemics influence society, cultures, art, and literature will be major topics of discussion.  The course is primarily discussion with short student presentations.  In addition, 3-4 short "Front Lines" talks by and discussion with CWRU and University Hospital clinicians will explore today's realities of epidemics, infection, and antibiotic resistance in the United States, Uganda, South Africa and elsewhere.

adding:  252 USNA The Future of Food Since World War II, science and technology have transformed the way Americans produce and consume food.  This transformation has been supported by government policies and accomplished through the application of industrial methods in agriculture, food processing, and food delivery.  Such methods have allowed a tiny fraction of the American population to produce vast quantities of food products at very low prices for American consumers.  But this American diet, while inexpensive, has turned out to be high in sugar, fat, and processed grains that are contributing to chronic disease such as diabetes and obesity.  In addition, environmental impacts of confined animal feeding operations, vast monoculture grain production, and global food transport are raising questions about the sustainability of American agribusiness.  This seminar will explore the evolution of food production in the United States since World War II and will ask the question: is it possible to nourish the world's population using nutrition and flavor as guiding principles rather that cost?  What is the true meaning of "sustainability" in agriculture?  The last third of the course will be devoted to creating a plan for using part of the University Farm to grow food for the University.

We will focus on types of green space and their community function, relationship to commerce, aesthetics, recreation, ecology, and health in particular.  Students will engage in group projects where they locate all underused space in Cleveland (vacant space, gray or brown fields) and will propose a new use for it as green space of some kind.  Individual research projects will be related to that site.  Lively class discussion and frequent reading responses required.  Mandatory field trip to sites in downtown Cleveland. Fall 2012

adding:  278 USNA Science and Medicine in Nazi Germany The founding principles of modern scientific and medical ethics, including the right of research subjects and patients to provide informed consent and to be protected from unnecessary physical and mental suffering, are enshrined in the ten points of the Nuremberg Code. This code was the direct result of war crimes trials in Nuremberg in the late 1940s, in which German scientists, medical researchers and physicians were prosecuted for their actions during the period of the National Socialist regime. However, while studying the specific crimes against humanity that were prosecuted in these trials is crucial to any understanding of this era, this seminar will also engage with two large questions. First, how were the members of the world's leading scientific and medical establishment during the 1920s, a reputation built over the course of the previous century or more, drawn into the racialist and nationalist ideologies of Nazism, leading to the crimes and cruelties tried at Nuremberg? And second, how have the results of those trials, along with the documentation of Nazi-era human experimentation, affected both the process of scientific research and the practice of medical ethics during the subsequent six decades?

This seminar will begin by exploring the historical context of the German scientific and medical community from the late 19th century until the beginning of the Nazi period, including the professionalization of scientific and medical research, the impact of the First World War on medical practice, and the global interest in eugenics during the interwar period. We will then discuss the eugenics-related sterilization and euthanasia, along with human experimentation in the course of genocide, from historical, medical, and ethical perspectives. Fall 2012

adding:  279 USNA The Perils of Being Bipedal The human lineage has been walking on two legs for millions of years. Indeed, we recognize our ancestors by the fact that they are bipedal. Nearly every portion of our skeleton is evolutionarily adapted to allow us to walk in this very peculiar way. Nevertheless, we continue to be plagued by numerous maladies directly linked to this unique method of walking. This class views the human body from the perspective of evolutionary medicine and asks why we alone suffer from ailments ranging from sprained ankles, to hernias, to fractured hips. This course will be structured in a seminar format and will revolve around class discussion. Fall 2012

adding:  280 USNA Extinction, Endangerment, and Biodiversity It is generally agreed that we are currently facing a "biodiversity crisis."  The rate of species extinction globally has been estimated as being as high as 3 per hour, or 27,000 species lost per year, with fears that this number could reach as many as 40,000 per year.  This rate of extinction is anywhere from 100 to 1,000 times the normal rate seen over he geological history of life.  Much of the blame for this crisis has been placed on human activities--development, deforestation, pollution, global warming, etc.--and biodiversity has become a political cause celebre for environmentally-minded politicians as well as biologists.  However, this topic is also controversial: these biodiversity figures are based on estimates, and biologists are racing to inventory the world's living species before it is too late.  Powerful economic and political interests are at stake here as well, and even if the severity of the crisis is recognized, it is by no means clear what to do about it.  This course will put the current biodiversity crisis and debate in the context of a broader history of scientific understanding of extinction and conservation.  We will examine how scientists have come to understand the processes of extinction and speciation, how this understanding has changed over the past 200 years, and how scientists and outside observers have mobilized to take political action based on an understanding of biology.  Topics to be discussed include paleontological theories of extinction, conservation biology, evolutionary theory, and biological diversity analysis.  We will also consider why these topics have been such a source of heated debate.  It turns out that our ideas of biological extinction and diversity influence our broader perceptions of endangerment and diversity in society and culture.  Understanding the history and current context of debates over biological diversity can help us understand why we as a culture are coming to recognize the value of diversity in general. Fall 2012
adding:  281 USNA Biology and Human Difference Diversity is one of the most celebrated values in modern society.  However, the way we understand human difference has been shaped by a legacy of more than 200 years of biological thought.  That legacy has influenced the categories we use to understand how human beings differ from one another: what "race" a person is, how we define qualities like "Intelligence," whether there are intrinsic biological differences between men and women, etc.  While current western society celebrates equality and egalitarianism, many of the biological and social concepts we use to understand human difference emerged at times when society thought very differently about these matters.  Biologists in the 19th and early 20th centuries developed theories that linked innate human ability to racial typology and gender which explicitly assumed that human beings are unequal, and which in many cases overtly reinforced cultural stereotypes and prejudices.  Many of these biological concepts have continued to influence both social and scientific thought throughout the 20th and into the 21st century.  This course will challenge students to think critically about the role biology has had in shaping conceptions of race, gender, sexuality, and intelligence by exposing them to a history of biological theories about the innateness of human difference, and by connecting that history to contemporary debates.  The first half of the seminar will examine 19th and early 20th century theories of racial typology and biological racism, eugenics, the evolution of instinct and behavior, intelligence testing, while the second half will consider the legacy of these ideas in current debates about topics such as genetics, sociobiology/evolutionary psychology, and reproductive choice. Students will see that scientists continue to grapple with fundamental questions about how determined by biology we are as individuals, and will gain appreciation for how those scientific debates affect individual lives and social policy.

adding:  282 USNA The Scientific Fringes: Contextualizing the Lure and Rejection of Science Debates about what constitutes science, non-science, and pseudoscience regularly emerge in U.S. political and popular debates.  In this course, we will examine debates about the demarcations between science and non-science, and we will consider case studies of individuals and groups that have challenged the boundaries of science.  The course begins with an overview of historical, philosophical, sociological, and anthropological understandings of science and its relationship to non-science.  After considering key foundational issues, we move on to several specific case studies of the "scientific fringes," including Ufology, paranormal investigation, Nazi science, astrology, Creationism, and chiropractics.  The course considers questions such as: What is science?  What distinguishes it from "pseudoscience" or non-science?  What views locate people at the scientific fringe?  Have these changed over time?  What draws people to the "scientific fringes" and what can this reveal about broader cultural understandings of science?  Is science related to belief?  In what ways?  What distinguishes science from belief?  How do scientists and scientific theories come to be so frequently contested in the political sphere? Fall 2012

adding:  283 USNA Cultures of Science From the laboratory to the museum, science is a dominant way in which we make sense of the world.  This seminar examines the cultures of science.  Drawing on the fields of anthropology, sociology, history, and science and technology studies, we explore the interplay, exchange, and fertile ground between "culture" and "science."  We analyze the cultural practices of scientists, the relationship between scientific and indigenous ways of knowing, and ethics of scientific knowledge, as well as scientifically mediated understandings of personhood, nation, legality, and truth.  We will consider case studies from the U.S., Latin America, Europe, Africa, and Asia that reflect on contemporary intellectual debates and public concerns.  The course considers the following questions: Is science cultural?  What does objectivity mean?  How are scientific facts produced?  Do our understandings of citizenship and the nation have any connection to science? Fall 2012

adding:  243 USSO The Art of Fact As evidenced by the tragedy that unfolded in New Orleans in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, we ignore the consequences of endemic poverty at our peril.  How do you evacuate a city filled with thousands of people too poor to own cars?  Where do you house them after they've been rescued from their drowned neighborhoods?  Although Cleveland won't likely be erased by flood, it's one of the poorest big cities in the nation making it vulnerable to disaster in times of crisis and an incubator for a host of thorny social problems.  Often, it's up to journalists to bring attention to these issues, give voice to the voiceless and force policymakers to come up with solutions to seemingly intractable problems.  In this seminar, we'll read and dissect the works of journalists who've written stories about complex social problems and have done so using many of the conventions employed by writers of fiction.  Writer Ben Yagoda described this literary journalism as "making facts dance."  We'll spend our time researching numerous social issues and learn to write about them in a clear and compelling voice.

adding:  260 USSO Spin, P.R., and America Today e live today surrounded by spin---corporations don't fire, they downsize; government pronouncements are assumed to be cynically slanted and misleading; even scholarly medical articles are written by public relations (p.r.) flacks.  The guiding principle isn't truth or reality but the right message and staying on it.  How and why has p.r. become such a seemingly potent force in our time?  What does this say about America and its values--about even the meaning of truth?  In this seminar we will explore the role of public relations and image-making, in American society today.  Our objectives are (1) Examine the users of p.r. today in business, politics and popular culture to shape images and define reality; (2) explore the tools used to construct and sell those messages and perceptions and (3) Analyze the values underlying these activities--to the end of deepening our understanding society today.  This seminar explores these issues through reading, both academic and popular writing, discussion, and research.  The writing assignments will be both academic and various forms of media and public relations formats.  We will use class time to discuss and review student writing. Fall 2012

We will cover such issues as race/class/gender and the law, legal ethics, legal education, the adversarial system, and the image and status of the lawyer in American culture. We will also look at the ways in which law and the legal profession affect popular culture and, conversely, the ways in which poplar views of legal problems and lawyers affect law. Fall 2012

adding:  279 USSY Navigating Contemporary Art Art has always had a shifting, complicated relationship to the general public.  In today's world, contemporary art is sometimes regarded as a detached, self-reflexive, and elite mystery reserved for in-the-know connoisseurs and aspiring scene-makers.  Yet there are many points of entry for meaningful dialogue about the art, the artists, and the audience that comprise the world of contemporary art.  This seminar will explore the critical and cultural contexts that can help foster this conversation.  It will include visits to local museums, galleries, and artists' studios, and culminate in a tour of the Progressive Art Collection.  The goal of the seminar is to inspire a genuine interest in contemporary art and provide students with the tools required to think, speak, and write more clearly about it. Fall 2012
