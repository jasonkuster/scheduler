Case Scheduler Installation Guide
r1.0 - Jason Kuster

Installing scheduler onto a server is a simple process with a few basic steps.

1. Install apache and mod_wsgi

If running Ubuntu or another Debian derivative, you should be able to type:
sudo apt-get install apache2 libapache2-mod-wsgi

Otherwise, use your distribution's package-management software or download the sources and compile them by hand.

2. Get the code.

Our code is hosted on Github, at http://github.com/hacsoc/scheduler. Simply clone our repository into a directory of your choice.

3. Configure Apache

Following Apache's naming structure, create a file in /etc/apache2/sites-available named xxx-scheduler, then create a link to it in /etc/apache2/sites-enabled. In this file, you will be configuring the site. Apache's documentation, plus any other sites in the folder will be very helpful for figuring out how to do this, and a sample is included below. Change the directory locations to whichever directory structure you have chosen.

<VirtualHost *:80>
	ServerName scheduler.case.edu
	ServerAlias www.scheduler.case.edu
	ServerAdmin jrk126@case.edu
	
	DocumentRoot /srv/www/scheduler/public_html
	
	ErrorLog /srv/www/scheduler/logs/error.log
	CustomLog /srv/www/scheduler/logs/access.log combined LogLevel info

	WSGIScriptAlias / /srv/www/scheduler/application/wsgi.py

	Alias /robots.txt /srv/www/scheduler/public_html/robots.txt
	Alias /favicon.ico /srv/www/scheduler/public_html/favicon.ico
	Alias /images /srv/www/scheduler/public_html/images
	Alias /static /srv/www/scheduler/public_html/static
</VirtualHost>

After these steps are done, execute:

sudo service apache2 restart

Congratulations!
