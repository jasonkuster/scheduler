# Login takes in a CAS host and a service url, a list of cookies, 
#a ticket, and an optional lifetime, security level, protocol, 
#path, and options. The CAS host is the address of the Central 
#Authentication System server against which the application 
#will be authenticating. The service url is the web address 
#of the service which is attempting to authenticate against CAS.
#Cookies and Ticket will be passed along from the web browser 
#and are both methods of authenticating against CAS. In the 
#absence of a valid cookie or ticket, the service will return 
#that the user has not been authenticated against CAS. Lifetime 
#defines the lifetime of the cookie, security level determines 
#https, protocol determines which CAS protocol to use, Path 
#dictates where on the service url to go, and opt gives any options.
