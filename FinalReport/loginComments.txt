#Check login takes the request object from Django 
#and the Service URL to which to redirect.
#This allows the user to re-log-in from any page, 
#rather than from just the main page.
#Check login authenticates the user with CAS and 
#passes the user's id back to views.py
#If the user is not authenticated, it returns 
#false back to views.py

#Redirect_To_CAS is very straightforward - it simply returns 
#a redirect object that redirects the user to CAS.
