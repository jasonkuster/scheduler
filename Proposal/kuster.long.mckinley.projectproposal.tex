\title{EECS 341 Project Proposal: Case Scheduler}

Currently, there only exist functional but not particularly elegant ways for students to visualize their class schedules. For our project, we want to make a better Case Scheduler, one which works fast and is easy for students to use.

When making a class schedule, it is very helpful to be able to see what your schedule looks like. The two systems currently available, SIS and scheduler.case.edu do an unsatisfactory job of displaying the schedule. The problem with SIS is that it's exceedingly slow and inefficient for course planning, and is much more suited to only doing course enrolment. The problem with scheduler.case.edu is that not only is it slow to open and do anything, but it is impossible to print without using the Print Screen function on you computer, exporting it to an image, and printing that image. In addition, there are many expansions which could be made to functionality, such as easy sharing of schedules and planning your schedule with friends.

We will be using two technologies to implement this scheduler. First, we will be using the Django Python library for programming our web application. Second, we will be using MySQL for our database.
